        Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in Judea, during the reign of

      <p className="quote">
        At about that time some astrologers from eastern lands arrived in
        Jerusalem, asking, <span className="sup">2</span>"Where is the newborn King

        have come to worship him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>King Herod was deeply disturbed by their
        question, and all Jerusalem was filled with rumors.
        <span className="sup">4</span>He called a meeting of the Jewish religious

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Did the prophets tell us where the Messiah would be born?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Yes, in Bethlehem," they said, "for this is
        what the prophet Micah <small>Micah 5:2</small> wrote:

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Then Herod sent a private message to the
        astrologers, asking them to come to see him; at this meeting he found
        out from them the exact time when they first saw the star. Then he told
        them, <span className="sup">8</span>"Go to Bethlehem and search for the
        child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and
        worship him too!"

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>After this interview the astrologers started

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Entering the house where the baby and Mary
        his mother were, they threw themselves down before him, worshipping.
        Then they opened their presents and gave him gold, frankincense and
        myrrh. <span className="sup">12</span>But when they returned to their own
        land, they didn't go through Jerusalem to report to Herod, for God had
        warned them in a dream to go home another way.

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>After they were gone, an angel of the Lord

        return, for King Herod is going to try to kill the child."
        <span className="sup">14</span>That same night he left for Egypt with Mary
        and the baby, <span className="sup">15</span>and stayed there until King
        Herod's death. This fulfilled the prophet's prediction,

        <span className="sup">16</span>Herod was furious when he learned that the
        astrologers had disobeyed him. Sending soldiers to Bethlehem, he ordered
        them to kill every baby boy two years old and under, both in the town

        appeared to them two years before. <span className="sup">17</span>This

        <span className="sup">34</span>But I say: Don't make any vows! And even to
        say, 'By heavens!' is a sacred vow to God, for the heavens are God's
        throne. <span className="sup">35</span>And if you say 'By the earth!' it is
        a sacred vow, for the earth is his footstool. And don't swear 'By
        Jerusalem!' for Jerusalem is the capital of the great King.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Don't even swear 'By my head!' for you can't
        turn one hair white or black. <span className="sup">37</span>Say just a

        be acting as true sons of your Father in heaven. For he gives his

        <span className="sup">3</span>But when you do a kindness to someone, do it

        reward you.

      <p class="jesus quote">

      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">

        feel sorry for them. Truly, that is the only reward they will ever get.
        <span className="sup">17</span>But when you fast, put on festive clothing,
        <span className="sup">18</span>so that no one will suspect you are hungry,

        <span className="sup">26</span>Look at the birds! They don't worry about
        what to eat--they don't need to sow or reap or store up food--for your
        heavenly Father feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than
        they are. <span className="sup">27</span>Will all your worries add a single

      <p class="jesus quote">

        <span className="sup">29</span>Yet King Solomon in all his glory was not
        clothed as beautifully as they. <span className="sup">30</span>And if God
        cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and gone tomorrow,
        won't he more surely care for you, O men of little faith?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31,32</span>"So don't worry at all about having enough
        food and clothing. Why be like the heathen? For they take pride in all
        these things and are deeply concerned about them. But your heavenly
        Father already knows perfectly well that you need them,
        <span className="sup">33</span>and he will give them to you if you give him
        first place in your life and live as he wants you to.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"So don't be anxious about tomorrow. God will

        About that time, Jesus was walking one day through some grainfields with

      <p class="jesus quote">
        "A farmer was sowing grain in his fields. <span className="sup">4</span>As

        <span className="sup">8</span>But some fell on good soil, and produced a

        <span className="sup">20</span>The shallow, rocky soil represents the heart

        <span className="sup">21</span>but he doesn't have much depth in his life,
        and the seeds don't root very deeply, and after a while when trouble
        comes, or persecution begins because of his beliefs, his enthusiasm
        fades, and he drops out. <span className="sup">22</span>The ground covered
        with thistles represents a man who hears the message, but the cares of

        less and less for God. <span className="sup">23</span>The good ground

        field from the potters as the Lord directed me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the
        Roman governor. "Are you the Jews' Messiah?" the governor asked him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">"Yes," <span>Jesus replied.</span></p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>But when the chief priests and other Jewish
        leaders made their many accusations against him, Jesus remained silent.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"Don't you hear what they are saying?" Pilate
        demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>But Jesus said nothing much to the governor's
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Now the governor's custom was to release one
        Jewish prisoner each year during the Passover celebration--anyone they
        wanted. <span className="sup">16</span>This year there was a particularly
        notorious criminal in jail named Barabbas,
        <span className="sup">17</span>and as the crowds gathered before Pilate's
        house that morning he asked them, "Which shall I release to
        you--Barabbas, or Jesus your Messiah?" <span className="sup">18</span>For he
        knew very well that the Jewish leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy
        because of his popularity with the people.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Just then, as he was presiding over the
        court, Pilate's wife sent him this message: "Leave that good man alone;
        for I had a terrible nightmare concerning him last night."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Meanwhile the chief priests and Jewish
        officials persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas' release, and for
        Jesus' death. <span className="sup">21</span>So when the governor asked
        again, "Which of these two shall I release to you?" the crowd shouted
        back their reply: "Barabbas!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"Then what shall I do with Jesus, your
        Messiah?" Pilate asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">And they shouted, "Crucify him!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"Why?" Pilate demanded. "What has he done
        wrong?" But they kept shouting, "Crucify! Crucify!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>When Pilate saw that he wasn't getting
        anywhere, and that a riot was developing, he sent for a bowl of water
        and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the
        blood of this good man. The responsibility is yours!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>And the mob yelled back, "His blood be on us
        and on our children!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then Pilate released Barabbas to them. And
        after he had whipped Jesus, he gave him to the Roman soldiers to take
        away and crucify. <span className="sup">27</span>But first they took him
        into the armory and called out the entire contingent.
        <span className="sup">28</span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on
        him, <span className="sup">29</span>and made a crown from long thorns and
        put it on his head, and placed a stick in his right hand as a scepter
        and knelt before him in mockery. "Hail, King of the Jews," they yelled.
        <span className="sup">30</span>And they spat on him and grabbed the stick
        and beat him on the head with it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>After the mockery, they took off the robe and
        put his own garment on him again, and took him out to crucify him.
        <span className="sup">32</span>As they were on the way to the execution
        grounds they came across a man from Cyrene, in Africa--Simon was his
        name--and forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
        <span className="sup">33</span>Then they went out to an area known as
        Golgotha, that is, "Skull Hill," <span className="sup">34</span>where the
        soldiers gave him drugged wine to drink; but when he had tasted it, he
        refused.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>After the crucifixion, the soldiers threw
        dice to divide up his clothes among themselves.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then they sat around and watched him as he
        hung there. <span className="sup">37</span>And they put a sign above his
        head, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Two robbers were also crucified there that
        morning, one on either side of him. <span className="sup">39</span>And the
        people passing by hurled abuse, shaking their heads at him and saying,
        <span className="sup">40</span>"So! You can destroy the Temple and build it
        again in three days, can you? Well, then, come on down from the cross if
        you are the Son of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41,42,43</span>And the chief priests and Jewish
        leaders also mocked him, "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't
        save himself! So you are the King of Israel, are you? Come down from the
        cross and we'll believe you! He trusted God--let God show his approval
        by delivering him! Didn't he say, 'I am God's Son'?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>And the robbers also threw the same in his
        teeth.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>That afternoon, the whole earth was covered
        with darkness for three hours, from noon until three o'clock.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>About three o'clock, Jesus shouted,
        <span class="jesus">"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani," </span>which means,

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>Some of the bystanders misunderstood and
        thought he was calling for Elijah. <span className="sup">48</span>One of
        them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine and put it on a stick and
        held it up to him to drink. <span className="sup">49</span>But the rest
        said, "Leave him alone. Let's see whether Elijah will come and save
        him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Then Jesus shouted out again, dismissed his
        spirit, and died. <span className="sup">51</span>And look! The curtain
        secluding the Holiest Places in the Temple was split apart from top to
        bottom; and the earth shook, and rocks broke,
        <span className="sup">52</span>and tombs opened, and many godly men and
        women who had died came back to life again.
        <span className="sup">53</span>After Jesus' resurrection, they left the

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>The soldiers at the crucifixion and their

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>And many women who had come down from Galilee
        with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance.
        <span className="sup">56</span>Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary the
        mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John (the sons

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>When evening came, a rich man from Arimathea

        release it to him. <span className="sup">59</span>Joseph took the body and
        wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, <span className="sup">60</span>and placed

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">62</span>The next day--at the close of the first day

        said, 'After three days I will come back to life again.'
        <span className="sup">64</span>So we request an order from you sealing the
        tomb until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>"Use your own Temple police," Pilate told

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">66</span>So they sealed the stone and posted guards to
        protect it from intrusion.

      <p className="quote">
        Early on Sunday morning, as the new day was dawning, Mary Magdalene and
        the other Mary went out to the tomb.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an
        angel of the Lord came down from heaven and rolled aside the stone and
        sat on it. <span className="sup">3</span>His face shone like lightning and
        his clothing was a brilliant white. <span className="sup">4</span>The guards
        shook with fear when they saw him, and fell into a dead faint.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then the angel spoke to the women. "Don't be
        frightened!" he said. "I know you are looking for Jesus, who was
        crucified, <span className="sup">6</span>but he isn't here! For he has come
        back to life again, just as he said he would. Come in and see where his
        body was lying . . . . <span className="sup">7</span>And now, go quickly and
        tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and that he is going
        to Galilee to meet them there. That is my message to them."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>The women ran from the tomb, badly frightened,
        but also filled with joy, and rushed to find the disciples to give them
        the angel's message. <span className="sup">9</span>And as they were running,
        suddenly Jesus was there in front of them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Good morning!"</span> he said. And they fell to the
        ground before him, holding his feet and worshipping him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus"

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>As the women were on the way into the city,
        some of the Temple police who had been guarding the tomb went to the
        chief priests and told them what had happened.
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>A meeting of all the Jewish leaders was
        called, and it was decided to bribe the police to say they had all been
        asleep when Jesus' disciples came during the night and stole his body.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"If the governor hears about it," the Council

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>So the police accepted the bribe and said
        what they were told to. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and is

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee,

      <p className="quote">
        Here begins the wonderful story of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>In the book written by the prophet Isaiah, God
        announced that he would send his Son to earth, and that a special
        messenger would arrive first to prepare the world for his coming.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"This messenger will live out in the barren
        wilderness," Isaiah said, "and will proclaim that everyone must
        straighten out his life to be ready for the Lord's arrival."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>This messenger was John the Baptist. He lived
        in the wilderness and taught that all should be baptized as a public
        announcement of their decision to turn their backs on sin, so that God
        could forgive them. <span className="sup">5</span>People from Jerusalem and
        from all over Judea traveled out into the Judean wastelands to see and
        hear John, and when they confessed their sins he baptized them in the
        Jordan River. <span className="sup">6</span>His clothes were woven from
        camel's hair and he wore a leather belt; locusts and wild honey were his
        food. <span className="sup">7</span>Here is a sample of his preaching:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Someone is coming soon who is far greater than I am, so much greater
        that I am not even worthy to be his slave. <span className="sup">8</span>I
        baptize you with water but he will baptize you with God's Holy Spirit!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in
        Galilee, and was baptized by John there in the Jordan River.
        <span className="sup">10</span>The moment Jesus came up out of the water, he
        saw the heavens open and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove
        descending on him, <span className="sup">11</span>and voice from heaven
        said, "You are my beloved Son; you are my Delight."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>Immediately the Holy Spirit urged Jesus
        into the desert. There, for forty days, alone except for desert animals,
        he was subjected to Satan's temptations to sin. And afterwards the
        angels came and cared for him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Later on, after John was arrested by King
        Herod, Jesus went to Galilee to preach God's Good News.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"At last the time has come!"
        <span>he announced. </span>"God's Kingdom is near! Turn from your sins
        and act on this glorious news!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>One day as Jesus was walking along the shores
        of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew fishing with
        nets, for they were commercial fishermen.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus called out to them,
        <span class="jesus"
          >"Come, follow me! And I will make you fishermen for the souls of
          men!"</span
        >
        <span className="sup">18</span>At once they left their nets and went along
        with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>A little farther up the beach, he saw
        Zebedee's sons, James and John, in a boat mending their nets.
        <span className="sup">20</span>He called them too, and immediately they left
        their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Jesus and his companions now arrived at the
        town of Capernaum and on Saturday morning went into the Jewish place of
        worship--the synagogue--where he preached.
        <span className="sup">22</span>The congregation was surprised at his sermon
        because he spoke as an authority, and didn't try to prove his points by
        quoting others--quite unlike what they were used to hearing!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>A man possessed by a demon was present and
        began shouting, <span className="sup">24</span>"Why are you bothering us,
        Jesus of Nazareth--have you come to destroy us demons? I know who you
        are--the holy Son of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Jesus curtly commanded the demon to say no
        more and to come out of the man. <span className="sup">26</span>At that the
        evil spirit screamed and convulsed the man violently and left him.
        <span className="sup">27</span>Amazement gripped the audience and they began
        discussing what had happened.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "What sort of new religion is this?" they asked excitedly. "Why, even
        evil spirits obey his orders!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>The news of what he done spread quickly
        through that entire area of Galilee.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30</span>Then, leaving the synagogue, he and his
        disciples went over to Simon and Andrew's home, where they found Simon's
        mother-in-law sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus about her
        right away. <span className="sup">31</span>He went to her bedside, and as he
        took her by the hand and helped her to sit up, the fever suddenly left,
        and she got up and prepared dinner for them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32,33</span>By sunset the courtyard was filled with
        the sick and demon-possessed, brought to him for healing; and a huge
        crowd of people from all over the city of Capernaum gathered outside the
        door to watch. <span className="sup">34</span>So Jesus healed great numbers
        of sick folk that evening and ordered many demons to come out of their
        victims. (But he refused to allow the demons to speak, because they knew
        who he was.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The next morning he was up long before
        daybreak and went out alone into the wilderness to pray.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36,37</span>Later, Simon and the others went out to
        find him, and told him, "Everyone is asking for you."

        Here are some of the story-illustrations Jesus gave to the people at
        that time:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "A man planted a vineyard and built a wall around it and dug a pit for
        pressing out the grape juice, and built a watchman's tower. Then he
        leased the farm to tenant farmers and moved to another country.
        <span className="sup">2</span>At grape-picking time he sent one of his men
        to collect his share of the crop. <span className="sup">3</span>But the
        farmers beat up the man and sent him back empty-handed.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"The owner then sent another of his men, who
        received the same treatment, only worse, for his head was seriously
        injured. <span className="sup">5</span>The next man he sent was killed; and
        later, others were either beaten or killed, until
        <span className="sup">6</span>there was only one left--his only son. He
        finally sent him, thinking they would surely give him their full
        respect.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"But when the farmers saw him coming they
        said, 'He will own the farm when his father dies. Come on, let's kill
        him--and then the farm will be ours!" <span className="sup">8</span>So they
        caught him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"What do you suppose the owner will do when he
        hears what happened? He will come and kill them all, and lease the
        vineyard to others. <span className="sup">10</span>Don't you remember
        reading this verse in the Scriptures? 'The Rock the builders threw away
        became the cornerstone, the most honored stone in the building!
        <span className="sup">11</span>This is the Lord's doing and it is an amazing
        thing to see.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>The Jewish leaders wanted to arrest him then
        and there for using this illustration, for they knew he was pointing at
        them--they were the wicked farmers in his story. But they were afraid to
        touch him for fear of a mob. So they left him and went away.
        <span className="sup">13</span>But they sent other religious and political
        leaders to talk with him and try to trap him into saying something he
        could be arrested for.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Teacher," these spies said, "we know you
        tell the truth no matter what! You aren't influenced by the opinions and
        desires of men, but sincerely teach the ways of God. Now tell us, is it
        right to pay taxes to Rome, or not?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Jesus saw their trick and said,

        <span className="sup">16</span>When they handed it to him he asked,

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Then the Sadducees stepped forward--a group
        of men who say there is no resurrection. Here was their question:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Teacher, Moses gave us a law that when a man
        dies without children, the man's brother should marry his widow and have
        children in his brother's name. <span className="sup">20,21,22</span>Well,
        there were seven brothers and the oldest married and died, and left no
        children. So the second brother married the widow, but soon he died too,
        and left no children. Then the next brother married her, and died
        without children, and so on until all were dead, and still there were no
        children; and last of all, the woman died too.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"What we want to know is this: In the
        resurrection, whose wife will she be, for she had been the wife of each
        of them?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus"
          >"Your trouble is that you don't know the Scriptures, and don't know
          the power of God. <span className="sup">25</span>For when these seven
          brothers and the woman rise from the dead, they won't be married--they
          will be like the angels.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But now as to whether there will be a
        resurrection--have you never read in the book of Exodus about Moses and
        the burning bush? God said to Moses, 'I <em>am</em> the God of Abraham,
        and I <em>am</em> the God of Isaac, and I <em>am</em> the God of Jacob.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"God was telling Moses that these men, though
        dead for hundreds of years, were still very much alive, for he would not
        have said, 'I <em>am</em> the God' of those who don't exist! You have
        made a serious error."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>One of the teachers of religion who was
        standing there listening to the discussion realized that Jesus had
        answered well. So he asked, "Of all the commandments, which is the most
        important?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus replied,

      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"The second is: 'You must love others as much

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>The teacher of religion replied, "Sir, you
        have spoken a true word in saying that there is only one God and no
        other. <span className="sup">33</span>And I know it is far more important to
        love him with all my heart and understanding and strength, and to love
        others as myself, than to offer all kinds of sacrifices on the altar of
        the Temple."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Realizing this man's understanding, Jesus

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Later, as Jesus was teaching the people in
        the Temple area, he asked them this question:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Why do your religious teachers claim that the Messiah must be a
        descendant of King David? <span className="sup">36</span>For David himself
        said--and the Holy Spirit was speaking through him when he said it--'God
        said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your
        footstool.' <span className="sup">37</span>Since David called him his Lord,
        how can he be his <em>son?</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        (This sort of reasoning delighted the crowd and they listened to him
        with great interest.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Here are some of the other things he taught
        them at this time:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Beware of the teachers of religion! For they love to wear the robes of
        the rich and scholarly, and to have everyone bow to them as they walk
        through the markets. <span className="sup">39</span>They love to sit in the
        best seats in the synagogues, and at the places of honor at banquets--
        <span className="sup">40</span>but they shamelessly cheat widows out of
        their homes and then, to cover up the kind of men they really are, they
        pretend to be pious by praying long prayers in public. Because of this,
        their punishment will be the greater."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then he went over to the collection boxes in
        the Temple and sat and watched as the crowds dropped in their money.
        Some who were rich put in large amounts. <span className="sup">42</span>Then
        a poor widow came and dropped in two pennies.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>He called his disciples to him and
        remarked,
        <span class="jesus"
          >"That poor widow has given more than all those rich men put together!
          For they gave a little of their extra fat, while she gave up her last

        As he was leaving the Temple that day, one of his disciples said,

      <p className="quote">

        Early in the morning the chief priests, elders and teachers of
        religion--the entire Supreme Court--met to discuss their next steps.
        Their decision was to send Jesus under armed guard to Pilate, the Roman
        governor.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the

      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3,4</span>Then the chief priests accused him of many

        all these charges against you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>But Jesus said no more, much to Pilate's
        amazement.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Now, it was Pilate's custom to release one
        Jewish prisoner each year at Passover time--any prisoner the people
        requested. <span className="sup">7</span>One of the prisoners at that time
        was Barabbas, convicted along with others for murder during an
        insurrection.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Now a mob began to crowd in toward Pilate,
        asking him to release a prisoner as usual.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"How about giving you the 'King of Jews'?"
        Pilate asked. "Is he the one you want released?"
        <span className="sup">10</span>(For he realized by now that this was a
        frameup, backed by the chief priests because they envied Jesus'

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>But at this point the chief priests whipped
        up the mob to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"But if I release Barabbas," Pilate asked

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>They shouted back, "Crucify him!"

        <span className="sup">14</span>"But why?" Pilate demanded. "What has he done

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then Pilate, afraid of a riot and anxious to
        please the people, released Barabbas to them. And he ordered Jesus
        flogged with a leaded whip, and handed him over to be crucified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16,17</span>Then the Roman soldiers took him into the

        his head. <span className="sup">18</span>Then they saluted, yelling, "Yea!

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "'Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just
        as he told you before he died!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>The women fled from the tomb, trembling and
        bewildered, too frightened to talk.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>It was early on Sunday morning when Jesus came
        back to life, and the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene--the
        woman from who he had cast out seven demons.
        <span className="sup">10,11</span>She found the disciples wet-eyed with
        grief and exclaimed that she had seen Jesus, and he was alive! But they
        didn't believe her!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Later that day he appeared to two who were
        walking from Jerusalem into the country, but they didn't recognize him
        at first because he had changed his appearance.
        <span className="sup">13</span>When they finally realized who he was, they
        rushed back to Jerusalem to tell the others, but no one believed them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Still later he appeared to the eleven
        disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their
        unbelief--their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him alive
        from the dead.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>And then he told them,
        <span class="jesus"
          >"You are to go into all the world and preach the Good News to
          everyone, everywhere. <span className="sup">16</span>Those who believe and
          are baptized will be saved. But those who refuse to believe will be
          condemned.</span
        >
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"And those who believe shall use my authority
        to cast out demons, and they shall speak new languages.
        <span className="sup">18</span>They will be able even to handle snakes with
        safety, and if they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them; and
        they will be able to place their hands on the sick and heal them."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with
        them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at God's right hand.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>And the disciples went everywhere preaching,
        and the Lord was with them and confirmed what they said by the miracles
        that followed their messages.

      <p className="quote">
        Dear friend who loves God: <span className="sup">1,2</span>Several
        biographies of Christ have already been written using as their source
        material the reports circulating among us from the early disciples and
        other eyewitnesses. <span className="sup">3</span>However, it occurred to me
        that it would be well to recheck all these accounts from first to last
        and after thorough investigation to pass this summary on to you,
        <span className="sup">4</span>to reassure you of the truth of all you were
        taught.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>My story begins with a Jewish priest,
        Zacharias, who lived when Herod was king of Judea. Zacharias was a
        member of the Abijah division of the Temple service corps. (His wife
        Elizabeth was, like himself, a member of the priest tribe of the Jews, a
        descendant of Aaron.) <span className="sup">6</span>Zacharias and Elizabeth
        were godly folk, careful to obey all of God's laws in spirit as well as
        in letter. <span className="sup">7</span>But they had no children, for
        Elizabeth was barren; and now they were both very old.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>One day as Zacharias was going about his
        work in the Temple--for his division was on duty that week--the honor
        fell to him by lot to enter the inner sanctuary and burn incense before
        the Lord. <span className="sup">10</span>Meanwhile, a great crowd stood
        outside in the Temple court, praying as they always did during that part
        of the service when the incense was being burned.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11,12</span>Zacharias was in the sanctuary when
        suddenly an angel appeared, standing to the right of the altar of
        incense! Zacharias was startled and terrified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>But the angel said, "Don't be afraid,
        Zacharias! For I have come to tell you that God has heard your prayer,
        and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son! And you are to name him
        John. <span className="sup">14</span>You will both have great joy and
        gladness at his birth, and many will rejoice with you.
        <span className="sup">15</span>For he will be one of the Lord's great men.
        He must never touch wine or hard liquor--and he will be filled with the
        Holy Spirit, even from before his birth! <span className="sup">16</span>And
        he will persuade many a Jew to turn to the Lord his God.
        <span className="sup">17</span>He will be a man of rugged spirit and power
        like Elijah, the prophet of old; and he will precede the coming of the
        Messiah, preparing the people for his arrival. He will soften adult
        hearts to become like little children's, and will change disobedient
        minds to the wisdom of faith."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Zacharias said to the angel, "But this is
        impossible! I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in
        years."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I stand
        in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to you with this good
        news! <span className="sup">20</span>And now, because you haven't believed
        me, you are to be stricken silent, unable to speak until the child is
        born. For my words will certainly come true at the proper time."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Meanwhile the crowds outside were waiting for
        Zacharias to appear and wondered why he was taking so long.
        <span className="sup">22</span>When he finally came out, he couldn't speak
        to them, and they realized from his gestures that he must have seen a
        vision in the Temple. <span className="sup">23</span>He stayed on at the
        Temple for the remaining days of his Temple duties and then returned
        home. <span className="sup">24</span>Soon afterwards Elizabeth his wife
        became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"How kind the Lord is," she exclaimed, "to
        take away my disgrace of having no children!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then following month God sent the angel
        Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee, <span className="sup">27</span>to
        a virgin, Mary, engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a
        descendant of King David.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Gabriel appeared to her and said,
        "Congratulations, favored lady! The Lord is with you!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think
        what the angel could mean.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"Don't be frightened, Mary," the angel told
        her, "for God had decided to wonderfully bless you!
        <span className="sup">31</span>Very soon now, you will become pregnant and
        have a baby boy, and you are to name him 'Jesus.'
        <span className="sup">32</span>He shall be very great and shall be called
        the Son of God. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his
        ancestor David. <span className="sup">33</span>And he shall reign over
        Israel forever; his Kingdom shall never end!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Mary asked the angel, "But how can I have a
        baby? I am a virgin."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit shall
        come upon you, and the power of God shall overshadow you; so the baby
        born to you will be utterly holy--the Son of God.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Furthermore, six months ago your Aunt
        Elizabeth--'the barren one,' they called her--became pregnant in her old
        age! <span className="sup">37</span>For every promise from God shall surely
        come true."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Mary said, "I am the Lord's servant, and I am
        willing to do whatever he wants. May everything you said come true." And
        then the angel disappeared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39,40</span>A few days later Mary hurried to the
        highlands of Judea to the town where Zacharias lived, to visit
        Elizabeth.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>At the sound of Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's
        child leaped within her and she was filled with the Holy Spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>She gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary,
        "You are the favored by God above all other women, and your child is
        destined for God's mightiest praise. <span className="sup">43</span>What an
        honor this is, that the mother of my Lord should visit me!
        <span className="sup">44</span>When you came in and greeted me, the instant
        I heard your voice, my baby moved in me for joy!
        <span className="sup">45</span>You believed that God would do what he said;
        that is why he has given you this wonderful blessing."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Mary responded, "Oh, how I praise the Lord.
        <span className="sup">47</span>How I rejoice in God my Savior!
        <span className="sup">48</span>For he took notice of his lowly servant girl,
        and now generation after generation forever shall call me blest of God.
        <span className="sup">49</span>For he, the mighty Holy One, has done great
        things to me. <span className="sup">50</span>His mercy goes on from
        generation to generation, to all who reverence him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>"How powerful is his mighty arm! How he
        scatters the proud and haughty ones! <span className="sup">52</span>He has
        torn princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly.
        <span className="sup">53</span>He has satisfied the hungry hearts and sent
        the rich away with empty hands. <span className="sup">54</span>And how he
        has helped his servant Israel! He has not forgotten his promise to be
        merciful. <span className="sup">55</span>For he promised our
        fathers--Abraham and his children--to be merciful to them forever."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">56</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months
        and then went back to her own home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>By now Elizabeth's waiting was over, for the
        time had come for the baby to be born--and it was a boy.
        <span className="sup">58</span>The word spread quickly to her neighbors and
        relatives of how kind the Lord had been to her, and everyone rejoiced.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>When the baby was eight days old, all the
        relatives and friends came for the circumcision ceremony. They all
        assumed the baby's name would be Zacharias, after his father.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>But Elizabeth said, "No! He must be name
        John!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>"What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one in
        all your family by that name." <span className="sup">62</span>So they asked
        the baby's father, talking to him by gestures.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">63</span>He motioned for a piece of paper and to
        everyone's surprise wrote, "His name is <em>John!</em>"
        <span className="sup">64</span>Instantly Zacharias could speak again, and he
        began praising God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>Wonder fell upon the whole neighborhood, and
        the news of what had happened spread through the Judean hills.
        <span className="sup">66</span>And everyone who heard about it thought long
        thoughts and asked, "I wonder what this child will turn out to be? For
        the hand of the Lord is surely upon him in some special way."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">67</span>Then his father Zacharias was filled with the
        Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">68</span>"Praise the Lord, God of Israel, for he has
        come to visit his people and has redeemed them.
        <span className="sup">69</span>He is sending us a Might Savior from the
        royal line of his servant David, <span className="sup">70</span>just as he
        promised through his holy prophets long ago--
        <span className="sup">71</span>someone to save us from our enemies, from all
        who hate us.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">72,73</span>"He has been merciful to our ancestors,
        yes, to Abraham himself, by remembering his sacred promise to him,
        <span className="sup">74</span>and by granting us the privilege of serving
        God fearlessly, freed from our enemies, <span className="sup">75</span>and
        by making us holy and acceptable, ready to stand in his presence
        forever.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">76</span>"And you, my little son, shall be called the
        prophet of the glorious God, for you will prepare the way for the
        Messiah. <span className="sup">77</span>You will tell his people how to find
        salvation through forgiveness of their sins.
        <span className="sup">78</span>All this will be because the mercy of our God
        is very tender, and heaven's dawn is about to break upon us,
        <span className="sup">79</span>to give light to those who sit in darkness
        and death's shadow, and to guide us to the path of peace."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">80</span>The little boy greatly loved God and when he

      <p className="quote">
        About this time Caesar Augustus, the Roman Emperor, decreed that a
        census should be taken throughout the nation.
        <span className="sup">2</span>(This census was taken when Quirinius was
        governor of Syria.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Everyone was required to return to his
        ancestral home for this registration. <span className="sup">4</span>And
        because Joseph was a member of the royal line, he had to go to Bethlehem
        in Judea, King David's ancient home--journeying there from the Galilean
        village of Nazareth. <span className="sup">5</span>He took with him Mary,
        his fiancée, who was obviously pregnant by this time.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>And while they were there, the time came for
        her baby to be born; <span className="sup">7</span>and she gave birth to her
        first child, a son. She wrapped him in a blanket and laid him in a
        manger, because there was no room for them in the village inn.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>That night some shepherds were in the fields
        outside the village, guarding their flocks of sheep.
        <span className="sup">9</span>Suddenly an angel appeared among them, and the
        landscape shone bright with the glory of the Lord. They were badly
        frightened, <span className="sup">10</span>but the angel reassured them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you the most joyful news every
        announced, and it is for everyone! <span className="sup">11</span>The
        Savior--yes, the Messiah, the Lord--has been born tonight in Bethlehem!
        <span className="sup">12</span>How will you recognize him? You will find a
        baby wrapped in a blanket, lying in a manger!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host
        of others--the armies of heaven--praising God:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Glory to God in the highest heaven," they
        sang, "and peace on earth for all those pleasing him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>When this great army of angels had returned
        again to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Come on! Let's go to
        Bethlehem! Let's see this wonderful thing that has happened, which the
        Lord has told us about."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>They ran to the village and found their way
        to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.
        <span className="sup">17</span>The shepherd told everyone what had happened
        and what the angel had said to them about this child.
        <span className="sup">18</span>All who heard the shepherds' story expressed
        astonishment, <span className="sup">19</span>but Mary quietly treasured
        these things in her heart and often thought about them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then the shepherds went back again to their
        fields and flocks, praising God for the visit of the angels, and because
        they had seen the child, just as the angel had told them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Eight days later, at the baby's circumcision
        ceremony, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he
        was even conceived.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>When the time came for Mary's purification
        offering at the Temple, as required by the laws of Moses after the birth
        of a child, his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the
        Lord; <span className="sup">23</span>for in these laws God had said, "If a
        woman's first child is a boy, he shall be dedicated to the Lord."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>At that time Jesus' parents also offered
        their sacrifice for purification--"either a pair of turtle-doves or two
        young pigeons" was the legal requirement.
        <span className="sup">25</span>That day a man named Simeon, a Jerusalem
        resident, was in the Temple. He was a good man, very devout, filled with
        the Holy Spirit and constantly expecting the Messiah to come soon.

      <p className="quote">
        In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius Caesar, a message
        came from God to John (the son of Zacharias), as he was living out in
        the deserts. (Pilate was governor over Judea at that time; Herod, over
        Galilee; his brother Philip, over Iturea and Trachonitis; Lysanias, over
        Abilene; and Annas and Caiaphas were High Priests.)
        <span className="sup">3</span>Then John went from place to place on both
        sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to
        show that they had turned to God and away from their sins, in order to
        be forgiven.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>In the words of Isaiah the prophet, John was
        "a voice shouting from the barren wilderness, 'Prepare a road for the
        Lord to travel on! Widen the pathway before him!
        <span className="sup">5</span>Level the mountains! Fill up the valleys!
        Straighten the curves! Smooth out the ruts!
        <span className="sup">6</span>And then all mankind shall see the Savior sent
        from God.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Here is a sample of John's preaching to the
        crowds that came for baptism: "You brood of snakes! You are trying to
        escape hell without truly turning to God! That is why you want to be
        baptized! <span className="sup">8</span>First go and prove by the way you
        live that you really have repented. And don't think you are safe because
        you are descendants of Abraham. That isn't enough. God can produce
        children of Abraham from these desert stones!
        <span className="sup">9</span>The axe of his judgment is poised over you,
        ready to sever your roots and cut you down. Yes, every tree that does
        not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>The crowd replied, "What do you want us to
        do?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"If you have two coats," he replied, "give
        one to the poor. If you have extra food, give it away to those who are
        hungry."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Even tax collectors--notorious for their
        corruption--came to be baptized and asked, "How shall we prove to you
        that we have abandoned our sins?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"By your honesty," he replied. "Make sure you
        collect no more taxes than the Roman government requires you to."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"And us," asked some soldiers, "what about
        us?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        John replied, "Don't extort money by threats and violence; don't accuse
        anyone of what you know he didn't do; and be content with your pay!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come
        soon, and eager to know whether or not John was he. This was the
        question of the hour, and was being discussed everywhere.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>John answered the question by saying, "I
        baptize only with water; but someone is coming soon who has far higher
        authority than mine; in fact, I am not even worthy of being his slave.
        He will baptize you with fire--with the Holy Spirit.
        <span className="sup">17</span>He will separate chaff from grain, and burn
        up the chaff with eternal fire and store away the grain."
        <span className="sup">18</span>He used many such warnings as he announced
        the Good News to the people.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19,20</span>(But after John had publicly criticized
        Herod, governor of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife,
        and for many other wrongs he had done, Herod put John in prison, thus
        adding this sin to all his many others.) <span className="sup">21</span>Then
        one day, after the crowds had been baptized, Jesus himself was baptized;
        and as he was praying, the heavens opened,
        <span className="sup">22</span>and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove
        settled upon him, and a voice from heaven said, "You are my much loved
        Son, yes, my delight."

        such honor or even to come and meet you. Just speak a word from where
        you are, and my servant boy will be healed! I know, because I am under
        the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my men.
        I only need to say 'Go!' and they go; or 'Come!' and they come; and to
        my slave, 'Do this or that,' and he does it. So just say, 'Be healed!'

        began to starve. <span className="sup">15</span>He persuaded a local farmer
        to hire him to feed his pigs. <span className="sup">16</span>The boy became
        so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the swine looked good to
        him. And no one gave him anything.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"When he finally came to his senses, he said
        to himself, 'At home even the hired men have food enough and to spare,
        and here I am, dying of hunger! <span className="sup">18</span>I will go
        home to my father and say, "Father, I have sinned against both heaven
        and you, <span className="sup">19</span>and am no longer worthy of being
        called your son. Please take me on as a hired man."'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"So he returned home to his father. And while
        he was still a long distance away, his father saw him coming, and was
        filled with loving pity and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned
        against heaven and you, and am not worthy of being called your son--'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"But his father said to the slaves, 'Quick!
        Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. And a jeweled ring
        for his finger; and shoes! <span className="sup">23</span>And kill the calf
        we have in the fattening pen. We must celebrate with a feast,
        <span className="sup">24</span>for this son of mine was dead and has
        returned to life. He was lost and is found.' So the party began.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Meanwhile, the older son was in the fields
        working; when he returned home, he heard dance music coming from the
        house, <span className="sup">26</span>and he asked one of the servants what
        was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"'Your brother is back,' he was told, 'and
        your father has killed the calf we were fattening and has prepared a
        great feast to celebrate his coming home again unharmed.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"The older brother was angry and wouldn't go
        in. His father came out and begged him, <span className="sup">29</span>but
        he replied, 'All these years I've worked hard for you and never once
        refused to do a single thing you told me to; and in all that time you
        never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends.
        <span className="sup">30</span>Yet when this son of yours comes back after
        spending your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the finest
        calf we have on the place.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"'Look, dear son,' his father said to him,
        'you and I are very close, and everything I have is yours.
        <span className="sup">31</span>But it is right to celebrate. For he is your
        brother; and he was dead and has come back to life! He was lost and is
        found!'"

        Jesus now told this story to his disciples:

      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"So his employer called him in and said,

      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"The accountant thought to himself, 'Now what?
        I'm through here, and I haven't the strength to go out and dig ditches,
        and I'm too proud to beg. <span className="sup">4</span>I know just the
        thing! And then I'll have plenty of friends to take care of me when I
        leave!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>"So he invited each one who owed money to
        his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one,
        'How much do you owe him?' 'My debt is 850 gallons of olive oil,' the
        man replied. 'Yes, here is the contract you signed,' the accountant told
        him. 'Tear it up and write another one for half that much!'

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"'And how much do you owe him?' he asked the
        next man. 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' was the reply. 'Here,' the
        accountant said, 'take your note and replace it with one for only 800
        bushels!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"The rich man had to admire the rascal for
        being so shrewd. And it is true that the citizens of this world are more

        <span className="sup">9</span>But shall I tell <em>you</em> to act that way,
        to buy friendship through cheating? Will this ensure your entry into an
        everlasting home in heaven? <span className="sup">10</span> <em>No!</em> For
        unless you are honest in small matters, you won't be in large ones. If
        you cheat even a little, you won't be honest with greater
        responsibilities. <span className="sup">11</span>And if you are
        untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true
        riches of heaven? <span className="sup">12</span>And if you are not faithful

      <p className="quote">
        Before anything else existed, there was Christ, with God. He has always
        been alive and is himself God. <span className="sup">3</span>He created
        everything there is--nothing exists that he didn't make.
        <span className="sup">4</span>Eternal life is in him, and this life gives
        light to all mankind. <span className="sup">5</span>His life is the light
        that shines through the darkness--and the darkness can never extinguish
        it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6,7</span>God sent John the Baptist as a witness to
        the fact that Jesus Christ is the true Light.
        <span className="sup">8</span>John himself was not the Light; he was only a
        witness to identify it. <span className="sup">9</span>Later on, the one who
        is the true Light arrived to shine on everyone coming into the world.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>But although he made the world, the world
        didn't recognize him when he came. <span className="sup">11,12</span>Even in
        his own land and among his own people, the Jews, he was not accepted.
        Only a few would welcome and receive him. But to all who received him,
        he gave the right to become children of God. All they needed to do was
        to trust him to save them. <span className="sup">13</span>All those who
        believe this are reborn!--not a physical rebirth resulting from human
        passion or plan--but from the will of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>And Christ became a human being and lived
        here on earth among us and was full of loving forgiveness and truth. And
        some of us have seen his glory--the glory of the only Son of the
        heavenly Father!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>John pointed him out to the people, telling
        the crowds, "This is the one I was talking about when I said, 'Someone
        is coming who is greater by far than I am--for he existed long before I
        did!'" <span className="sup">16</span>We have all benefited from the rich
        blessings he brought to us--blessing upon blessing heaped upon us!
        <span className="sup">17</span>For Moses gave only the Law with its rigid
        demands and merciless justice, while Jesus Christ brought us loving
        forgiveness as well. <span className="sup">18</span>No one has ever actually
        seen God, but, of course, his only Son has, for he is the companion of
        the Father and has told us all about him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>The Jewish leaders sent priests and assistant
        priests from Jerusalem to ask John whether he claimed to be the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>He denied it flatly, "I am not the Christ."
        he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Well then, who are you?" they asked. "Are
        you Elijah?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"No," he replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">"Are you the Prophet?"</p>
      <p className="quote">"No."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"Then who are you? Tell us, so we can give an
        answer to those who sent us. What do you have to say for yourself?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>He replied, "I am a voice from the barren
        wilderness, shouting as Isaiah prophesied, 'Get ready for the coming of
        the Lord!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24,25</span>Then those who were sent by the Pharisees
        asked him, "If you aren't the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet, what
        right do you have to baptize?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>John told them, "I merely baptize with water,
        but right here in the crowd is someone you have never met,
        <span className="sup">27</span>who will soon begin his ministry among you,
        and I am not even fit to be his slave."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>This incident took place at Bethany, a
        village on the other side of the Jordan River where John was baptizing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him
        and said, "Look! There is the Lamb of God who takes away the world's
        sin! <span className="sup">30</span>He is the one I was talking about when I
        said, 'Soon a man far greater than I am is coming, who existed long
        before me!' <span className="sup">31</span>I didn't know he was the one, but
        I am here baptizing with water in order to point him out to the nation
        of Israel."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Then John told about seeing the Holy Spirit
        in the form of a dove descending from heaven and resting upon Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"I didn't know he was the one," John said
        again, "but at the time God sent me to baptize he told me, 'When you see
        the Holy Spirit descending and resting upon someone--he is the one you
        are looking for. He is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
        <span className="sup">34</span>I saw it happen to this man, and I therefore
        testify that he is the Son of God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The following day as John was standing with
        two of his disciples, <span className="sup">36</span>Jesus walked by. John
        looked at him intently and then declared, "See! There is the Lamb of
        God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Then John's two disciples turned and followed
        Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Jesus looked around and saw them following.
        <span class="jesus">"What do you want?"</span> he asked them.

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>

        him to the place where he was staying and were with him from about four
        o'clock that afternoon until the evening.
        <span className="sup">40</span>(One of these men was Andrew, Simon Peter's
        brother.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">

        Two days later Jesus' mother was a guest at a wedding in the village of

        <span className="sup">6</span>Six stone waterpots were standing there; they
        were used for Jewish ceremonial purposes and held perhaps twenty to
        thirty gallons each. <span className="sup">7,8</span>Then Jesus told the

        <span className="sup">14</span>In the Temple area he saw merchants selling
