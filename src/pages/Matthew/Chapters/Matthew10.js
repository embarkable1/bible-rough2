        <span className="sup">5</span>Jesus sent them out with these
        instructions:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't go to the Gentiles or the Samaritans,
          <span className="sup">6</span>but only to the people of Israel--God's
          lost sheep. <span className="sup">7</span>Go and announce to them that
          the Kingdom of Heaven is near. <span className="sup">8</span>Heal the
          sick, raise the dead, cure the lepers, and cast out demons. Give as
          freely as you have received!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"Don't take any money with you;
        <span className="sup">10</span>don't even carry a duffle bag with extra
        clothes and shoes, or even a walking stick; for those you help should
        feed and care for you. <span className="sup">11</span>Whenever you enter
        a city or village, search for a godly man and stay in his home until you
        leave for the next town. <span className="sup">12</span>When you ask
        permission to stay, be friendly, <span className="sup">13</span>and if
        it turns out to be a godly home, give it your blessing; if not, keep the
        blessing. <span className="sup">14</span>Any city or home that doesn't
        welcome you--shake off the dust of that place from your feet as you
        leave. <span className="sup">15</span>Truly, the wicked cities of Sodom
        and Gomorrah will be better off at Judgment Day than they.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"I am sending you out as sheep among
        wolves. Be as wary as serpents and harmless as doves.
        <span className="sup">17</span>But beware! For you will be arrested and
        tried, and whipped in the synagogues. <span className="sup">18</span>
        Yes, and you must stand trial before governors and kings for my sake.
        This will give you the opportunity to tell them about me, yes, to
        witness to the world.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"When you are arrested, don't worry about
        what to say at your trial, for you will be given the right words at the
        right time. <span className="sup">20</span>For it won't be you doing the
        talking--it will be the Spirit of your heavenly Father speaking through
        you!

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Brother shall betray brother to death,
        and fathers shall betray their own children. And children shall rise
        against their parents and cause their deaths.
        <span className="sup">22</span>Everyone shall hate you because you
        belong to me. But all of you who endure to the end shall be saved.

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"When you are persecuted in one city,
        flee to the next! I will return before you have reached them all!
        <span className="sup">24</span>A student is not greater than his
        teacher. A servant is not above his master.{' '}
        <span className="sup">25</span>The student shares his teacher's fate.
        The servant shares his master's! And since I, the master of the
        household, have been called 'Satan,' how much more will you!{' '}
        <span className="sup">26</span>But don't be afraid of those who threaten
        you. For the time is coming when the truth will be revealed: their
        secret plots will become public information.

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"What I tell you now in the gloom, shout
        abroad when daybreak comes. What I whisper in your ears, proclaim from
        the housetops!

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"Don't be afraid of those who can kill
        only your bodies--but can't touch your souls! Fear only God who can
        destroy both soul and body in hell. <span className="sup">29</span>Not
        one sparrow (What do they cost? Two for a penny?) can fall to the ground
        without your Father knowing it. <span className="sup">30</span>And the
        very hairs of your head are all numbered.{' '}

        me, I will openly deny him before my Father in heaven.

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Don't imagine that I came to bring peace
        to the earth! No, rather, a sword. <span className="sup">35</span>I have
        come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother,
        and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law--
        <span className="sup">36</span>a man's worst enemies will be right in
        his own home! <span className="sup">37</span>If you love your father and
        mother more than you love me, you are not worthy of being mine; or if
        you love your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of being
        mine.

        a reward like theirs.
