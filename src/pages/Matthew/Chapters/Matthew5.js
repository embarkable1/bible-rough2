      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day as the crowds were gathering, he went up the hillside with his
        disciples and sat down and taught them there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Humble men are very fortunate!" <span>he told them, </span>"for the
          Kingdom of Heaven is given to them. <span className="sup">4</span>
          Those who mourn are fortunate! for they shall be comforted.
          <span className="sup">5</span>The meek and lowly are fortunate! for
          the whole wide world belongs to them.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"Happy are those who long to be just and
        good, for they shall be completely satisfied.{' '}
        <span className="sup">7</span>Happy are the kind and merciful, for they
        shall be shown mercy.
        <span className="sup">8</span>Happy are those whose hearts are pure, for
        they shall see God. <span className="sup">9</span>Happy are those who
        strive for peace--they shall be called the sons of God.
        <span className="sup">10</span>Happy are those who are persecuted
        because they are good, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"When you are reviled and persecuted and
        lied about because you are my followers--wonderful!
        <span className="sup">12</span>Be <em>happy</em> about it! Be
        <em>very glad!</em> for a <em>tremendous reward</em> awaits you up in
        heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted too.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"You are the world's seasoning, to make
        it tolerable. If you lose your flavor, what will happen to world? And
        you yourselves will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.
        <span className="sup">14</span>You are the world's light--a city on a
        hill, glowing in the night for all to see.{' '}
        <span className="sup">15,16</span>Don't hide your light! Let it shine
        for all; let your good deeds glow for all to see, so that they will
        praise your heavenly Father.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"Don't misunderstand why I have come--it
        isn't to cancel the laws of Moses and the warnings of the prophets. No,
        I came to fulfill them, and to make them all come true.
        <span className="sup">18</span>With all the earnestness I have I say:
        Every law in the Book will continue until its purpose is achieved.
        <span className="sup">19</span>And so if anyone breaks the least
        commandment, and teaches others to, he shall be the least in the Kingdom
        of Heaven. But those who teach God's laws <em>and obey them</em> shall
        be great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But I warn you--unless your goodness is
        greater than that of the Pharisees and other Jewish leaders, you can't
        get into the Kingdom of Heaven at all!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Under the laws of Moses the rule was,
        'If you murder, you must die.' <span className="sup">22</span>But I have
        added to that rule, and tell you that if you are only <em>angry,</em>{' '}
        even in your own home, you are in danger of judgment! If you call your
        friend an idiot, you are in danger of being brought before the court.
        And if you curse him, you are in danger of the fires of hell.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"So if you are standing before the altar
        in the Temple, offering a sacrifice to God, and suddenly remember that a
        friend has something against you, <span className="sup">24</span>leave
        your sacrifice there beside the altar and go and apologize and be
        reconciled to him, and then come and offer your sacrifice to God.
        <span className="sup">25</span>Come to terms quickly with your enemy
        before it is too late and he drags you into court and you are thrown
        into a debtor's cell, <span className="sup">26</span>for you will stay
        there until you have paid the last penny.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"The laws of Moses said, 'You shall not
        commit adultery.' <span className="sup">28</span>But I say: Anyone who
        even looks at a woman with lust in his eye has already committed
        adultery with her in his heart. <span className="sup">29</span>So if
        your eye--even if it is your best eye!--causes you to lust, gouge it out
        and throw it away. Better for part of you to be destroyed than for all
        of you to be cast into hell. <span className="sup">30</span>And if your
        hand--even your right hand--causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it
        away. Better that than find yourself in hell.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"The law of Moses says, 'If anyone wants
        to be rid of his wife, he can divorce her merely by giving her a letter
        of dismissal.' <span className="sup">32</span>But I say that a man who
        divorces his wife, except for fornication, causes her to commit adultery
        if she marries again. And he who marries her commits adultery.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"Again, the law of Moses says, 'You shall
        not break your vows to God, but must fulfill them all.'
        <span className="sup">34</span>But I say: Don't make any vows! And even
        to say, 'By heavens!' is a sacred vow to God, for the heavens are God's
        throne. <span className="sup">35</span>And if you say 'By the earth!' it
        is a sacred vow, for the earth is his footstool. And don't swear 'By
        Jerusalem!' for Jerusalem is the capital of the great King.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Don't even swear 'By my head!' for you
        can't turn one hair white or black. <span className="sup">37</span>Say
        just a simple 'Yes, I will' or 'No, I won't.' Your word is enough. To
        strengthen your promise with a vow shows that something is wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"The law of Moses says, 'If a man gouges
        out another's eye, he must pay with his own eye. If a tooth gets knocked
        out, knock out the tooth of the one who did it.'
        <span className="sup">39</span>But I say: Don't resist violence! If you
        are slapped on one cheek, turn the other too.{' '}
        <span className="sup">40</span>If you are ordered to court, and your
        shirt is taken from you, give your coat too.{' '}
        <span className="sup">41</span>If the military demand that you carry
        their gear for a mile, carry it two.
        <span className="sup">42</span>Give to those who ask, and don't turn
        away from those who want to borrow.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"There is a saying, 'Love your
        <em>friends</em> and hate your enemies.' <span className="sup">44</span>
        But I say: Love your <em>enemies!</em> Pray for those who
        <em>persecute</em> you! <span className="sup">45</span>In that way you
        will be acting as true sons of your Father in heaven. For he gives his
        sunlight to both the evil and the good, and sends rain on the just and
        on the unjust too. <span className="sup">46</span>If you love only those
        who love you, what good is that? Even scoundrels do that much.
        <span className="sup">47</span>If you are friendly only to your friends,
        how are you different from anyone else? Even the heathen do that.
        <span className="sup">48</span>But you are to be perfect, even as your
        Father in heaven is perfect.
