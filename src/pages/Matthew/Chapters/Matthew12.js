      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        About that time, Jesus was walking one day through some grainfields with
        his disciples. It was on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of worship, and his
        disciples were hungry; so they began breaking off heads of wheat and
        eating the grain.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>But some Pharisees saw them do it and
        protested, "Your disciples are breaking the law. They are harvesting on
        the Sabbath."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>But Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Haven't you ever read what King David did when he and his friends
          were hungry? <span className="sup">4</span>He went into the Temple and
          they ate the special bread permitted to the priests alone. That was
          breaking the law too. <span className="sup">5</span>And haven't you
          ever read in the law of Moses how the priests on duty in the Temple
          may work on the Sabbath? <span className="sup">6</span>And truly, one
          is here who is greater than the Temple! <span className="sup">7</span>
          But if you had known the meaning of this Scripture verse, 'I want you
          to be merciful more than I want your offerings,' you would not have
          condemned those who aren't guilty! <span className="sup">8</span>For
          I, the Messiah, am master even of the Sabbath."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then he went over to the synagogue,
        <span className="sup">10</span>and noticed there a man with a deformed
        hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, "Is it legal to work by healing on the
        Sabbath day?" (They were, of course, hoping he would say "Yes," so they
        could arrest him!) <span className="sup">11</span>This was his answer:
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you had just one sheep, and it fell into a well on the Sabbath,
          would you work to rescue it that day? Of course you would.
          <span className="sup">12</span>And how much more valuable is a person
          than a sheep! Yes, it is right to do good on the Sabbath."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then he said to the man,
        <span class="jesus">"Stretch out your arm."</span> And as he did, his
        hand became normal, just like the other one!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then the Pharisees called a meeting to
        plot Jesus' arrest and death. <span className="sup">15</span>But he knew
        what they were planning, and left the synagogue, with many following
        him. He healed all the sick among them, <span className="sup">16</span>
        but he cautioned them against spreading the news about his miracles.
        <span className="sup">17</span>This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah
        concerning him:
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"Look at my Servant.
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">See my Chosen One.</p>
      <p className="quote__long">He is my Beloved, in whom my soul delights.</p>
      <p className="quote__long">I will put my Spirit upon him,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">And he will judge the nations.</p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">19</span>He does not fight nor shout;
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">He does not raise his voice!</p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">20</span>He does not crush the weak,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">Or quench the smallest hope;</p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        He will end all conflict with his final victory,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">21</span>And his name shall be the hope
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        Of all the world." <small>Isaiah 42:1-4</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Then a demon-possessed man--he was both
        blind and unable to talk--was brought to Jesus, and Jesus healed him so
        that he could both speak and see. <span className="sup">23</span>The
        crowd was amazed. "Maybe Jesus is the Messiah!" they exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>But when the Pharisees heard about the
        miracle they said, "He can cast out demons because he is Satan, king of
        devils."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Jesus knew their thoughts and replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "A divided kingdom ends in ruin. A city or home divided against itself
          cannot stand. <span className="sup">26</span>And if Satan is casting
          out Satan, he is fighting himself, and destroying his own kingdom.{' '}
          <span className="sup">27</span>And if, as you claim, I am casting out
          demons by invoking the powers of Satan, then what power do your own
          people use when they cast them out? Let them answer your accusation!{' '}
          <span className="sup">28</span>But if I am casting out demons by the
          Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.
          <span className="sup">29</span>One cannot rob Satan's kingdom without
          first binding Satan. Only then can his demons be cast out!
          <span className="sup">30</span>Anyone who isn't helping me is harming
          me.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31,32</span>"Even blasphemy against me or any
        other sin can be forgiven--all except one: speaking against the Holy
        Spirit shall never be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to
        come.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"A tree is identified by its fruit. A
        tree from a select variety produces good fruit; poor varieties don't.
        <span className="sup">34</span>You brood of snakes! How could evil men
        like you speak what is good and right? For a man's heart determines his
        speech. <span className="sup">35</span>A good man's speech reveals the
        rich treasures within him. An evil hearted man is filled with venom, and
        his speech reveals it. <span className="sup">36</span>And I tell you
        this, that you must give account on Judgment Day for every idle word you
        speak.
        <span className="sup">37</span>Your words now reflect your fate then:
        either you will be justified by them or you will be condemned."

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>One day some of the Jewish leaders,
        including some Pharisees, came to Jesus asking him to show them a
        miracle.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39,40</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Only an evil, faithless nation would ask for further proof; and none
          will be given except what happened to Jonah the prophet! For as Jonah
          was in the great fish for three days and three nights, so I, the
          Messiah, shall be in the heart of the earth three days and three
          nights. <span className="sup">41</span>The men of Nineveh shall arise
          against this nation at the judgment and condemn you. For when Jonah
          preached to them, they repented and turned to God from all their evil
          ways. And now a greater than Jonah is here--and you refuse to believe
          him. <span className="sup">42</span>The Queen of Sheba shall rise
          against this nation in the judgment, and condemn it; for she came from
          a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and now a greater than
          Solomon is here--and you refuse to believe him.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44,45</span>"This evil nation is like a man
        possessed by a demon. For if the demon leaves, it goes into the deserts
        for a while, seeking rest but finding none. Then it says, 'I will return
        to the man I came from.' So it returns and finds the man's heart clean
        but empty! Then the demon finds seven other spirits more evil than
        itself, and all enter the man and live in him. And so he is worse off
        than before."

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46,47</span>As Jesus was speaking in a crowded
        house his mother and brothers were outside, wanting to talk with him.
        When someone told him they were there, <span className="sup">48</span>he
        remarked,
        <span class="jesus">"Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?" </span>
        <span className="sup">49</span>He pointed to his disciples.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Look!" <span>he said, </span>"these are my mother and brothers."

        <span className="sup">50</span>Then he added,
