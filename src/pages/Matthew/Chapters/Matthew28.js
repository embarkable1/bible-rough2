      <h3>Chapter 28</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Early on Sunday morning, as the new day was dawning, Mary Magdalene and
        the other Mary went out to the tomb.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Suddenly there was a great earthquake; for
        an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and rolled aside the stone
        and sat on it. <span className="sup">3</span>His face shone like
        lightning and his clothing was a brilliant white.{' '}
        <span className="sup">4</span>The guards shook with fear when they saw
        him, and fell into a dead faint.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then the angel spoke to the women. "Don't
        be frightened!" he said. "I know you are looking for Jesus, who was
        crucified, <span className="sup">6</span>but he isn't here! For he has
        come back to life again, just as he said he would. Come in and see where
        his body was lying . . . . <span className="sup">7</span>And now, go
        quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and that
        he is going to Galilee to meet them there. That is my message to them."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>The women ran from the tomb, badly
        frightened, but also filled with joy, and rushed to find the disciples
        to give them the angel's message. <span className="sup">9</span>And as
        they were running, suddenly Jesus was there in front of them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Good morning!"</span> he said. And they fell to the
        ground before him, holding his feet and worshipping him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't be frightened! Go tell my brothers to leave at once for
          Galilee, to meet me there."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>As the women were on the way into the
        city, some of the Temple police who had been guarding the tomb went to
        the chief priests and told them what had happened.
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>A meeting of all the Jewish leaders
        was called, and it was decided to bribe the police to say they had all
        been asleep when Jesus' disciples came during the night and stole his
        body.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"If the governor hears about it," the
        Council promised, "we'll stand up for you and everything will be all
        right."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>So the police accepted the bribe and said
        what they were told to. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and is
        still believed by them to this very day.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then the eleven disciples left for
        Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had said they would find him.
        <span className="sup">17</span>There they met him and worshiped him--but
        some of them weren't sure it really was Jesus!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>He told his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I have been given all authority in heaven and earth.
          <span className="sup">19</span>Therefore go and make disciples in all
          the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son
          and of the Holy Spirit, <span className="sup">20</span>and then teach
          these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you; and be
          sure of this--that I am with you always, even to the end of the
          world."
        </span>
      </p>
