      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus' claim of being
        the Messiah by asking him to show them some great demonstrations in the
        skies.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2,3</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are good at reading the weather signs of the skies--red sky
          tonight means fair weather tomorrow; red sky in the morning means foul
          weather all day--but you can't read the obvious sings of the times!
          <span className="sup">4</span>This evil, unbelieving nation is asking
          for some strange sign in the heavens, but no further proof will be
          given except the miracle that happened to Jonah."
        </span>
        Then Jesus walked out on them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Arriving across the lake, the disciples
        discovered they had forgotten to bring any food.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Watch out!" <span>Jesus warned them; </span>"beware of the yeast of
          the Pharisees and Sadducees."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>They thought he was saying this because
        they had forgotten to bring bread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and
        told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "O men of little faith! Why are you so worried about having no food?
          <span className="sup">9</span>Won't you ever understand? Don't you
          remember at all the 5,000 I fed with five loaves, and the basketfuls
          left over? <span className="sup">10</span>Don't you remember the 4,000
          I fed, and all that was left? <span className="sup">11</span>How could
          you even think I was talking about food? But again I say, 'Beware of
          the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Then at last they understood that by
        "yeast" he meant the <em>wrong teaching</em> of the Pharisees and
        Sadducees.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>When Jesus came to Caesarea Philippi, he
        asked his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">"Who are the people saying I am?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Well," they replied, "some say John the
        Baptist; some, Elijah; some, Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Who do <em>you</em> think I am?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Simon Peter answered, "The Christ, the
        Messiah, the Son of the living God."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"God has blessed you, Simon, son of
        Johah,"
        <span>Jesus said, </span>"for my Father in heaven has personally
        revealed this to you--this is not from any human source.
        <span className="sup">18</span>You are Peter, a stone; and upon this
        rock I will build my church; and all the powers of hell shall not
        prevail against it. <span className="sup">19</span>And I will give you
        the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven; whatever doors you lock on earth
        shall be locked in heaven; and whatever doors you open on earth shall be
        open in heaven!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then he warned the disciples against
        telling others that he was the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>From then on Jesus began to speak plainly
        to his disciples about going to Jerusalem, and what would happen to him
        there--that he would suffer at the hands of the Jewish leaders, that he
        would be killed, and that three days later he would be raised to life
        again.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>But Peter took him aside to remonstrate
        with him. "Heaven forbid, sir," he said. "This is not going to happen to
        you!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus turned on Peter and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Get away from me, you Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me. You are
          thinking merely from a human point of view, and not from God's."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Then Jesus said to the disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him deny himself and
          take up his cross and follow me. <span className="sup">25</span>For
          anyone who keeps his life for himself shall lose it; and anyone who
          loses his life for me shall find it again.{' '}
          <span className="sup">26</span>What profit is there if you gain the
          whole world--and lose eternal life? What can be compared with the
          value of eternal life?
          <span className="sup">27</span>For I, the Son of Mankind, shall come
          with my angels in the glory of my Father and judge each person
          according to his deeds. <span className="sup">28</span>And some of you
          standing right here now will certainly live to see me coming in my
          Kingdom."
