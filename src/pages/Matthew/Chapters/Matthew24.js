        As Jesus was leaving the Temple grounds, his disciples came along and
        wanted to take him on a tour of the various Temple buildings.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>But he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "All these buildings will be knocked down, with not one stone left on
          top of another!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"When will this happen?" the disciples
        asked him later, as he sat on the slopes of the Mount of Olives. "What
        events will signal your return, and the end of the world?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">4</span>Jesus told them,{' '}
        </span>
        "Don't let anyone fool you. <span className="sup">5</span>For many will
        come claiming to be the Messiah, and will lead many astray.
        <span className="sup">6</span>When you hear of wars beginning, this does
        not signal my return; these must come, but the end is not yet.
        <span className="sup">7</span>The nations and kingdoms of the earth will
        rise against each other and there will be famines and earthquakes in
        many places. <span className="sup">8</span>But all this will be only the
        beginning of the horrors to come.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"Then you will be tortured and killed and
        hated all over the world because you are mine,
        <span className="sup">10</span>and many of you shall fall back into sin
        and betray and hate each other. <span className="sup">11</span>And many
        false prophets will appear and lead many astray.
        <span className="sup">12</span>Sin will be rampant everywhere and will
        cool the love of many. <span className="sup">13</span>But those enduring
        to the end shall be saved.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"And the Good News about the Kingdom will
        be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations will hear
        it, and then, finally, the end will come.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"So, when you see the horrible thing
        (told about by Daniel <small>Daniel 9:27,11:31,12:11</small> the
        prophet) standing in a holy place
        <span>
          (Let the reader take note.), <span className="sup">16</span>{' '}
        </span>
        then those in Judea must flee into the Judean hills.
        <span className="sup">17</span>Those on their porches must not even go
        inside to pack before they flee. <span className="sup">18</span>Those in
        the fields should not return to their homes for their clothes.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"And woe to pregnant women and to those
        with babies in those days. <span className="sup">20</span>And pray that
        your flight will not be in winter, or on the Sabbath.
        <span className="sup">21</span>For there will be persecution such as the
        world has never before seen in all its history, and will never see
        again.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"In fact, unless those days are
        shortened, all mankind will perish. But they will be shortened for the
        sake of God's chosen people.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"Then if anyone tells you, 'The Messiah
        has arrived at such and such a place, or has appeared here or there,'
        don't believe it. <span className="sup">24</span>For false Christs shall
        arise, and false prophets, and will do wonderful miracles, so that if it
        were possible, even God's chosen ones would be deceived.
        <span className="sup">25</span>See, I have warned you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"So if someone tells you the Messiah has
        returned and is out in the desert, don't bother to go and look. Or, that
        he is hiding at a certain place, don't believe it!
        <span className="sup">27</span>For as the lightning flashes across the
        sky from east to west, so shall my coming be, when I, the Messiah,
        return.
        <span className="sup">28</span>And wherever the carcass is, there the
        vultures will gather.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"Immediately after the persecution of
        those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give light,
        and the stars will seem to fall from the heavens, and the powers
        overshadowing the earth will be convulsed. <small>Ephesians 6:12</small>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"And then at last the signal of my coming
        will appear in the heavens and there will be deep mourning all around
        the earth. And the nations of the world will see me arrive in the clouds
        of heaven, with power and great glory. <span className="sup">31</span>
        And I shall send forth my angels with the sound of a mighty trumpet
        blast, and they shall gather my chosen ones from the farthest ends of
        the earth and heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"Now learn a lesson from the fig tree.
        When her branch is tender and the leaves begin to sprout, you know that
        summer is almost here. <span className="sup">33</span>Just so, when you
        see all these things beginning to happen, you can know that my return is
        near, even at the doors. <span className="sup">34</span>Then at last
        this age will come to its close.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>"Heaven and earth will disappear, but my
        words remain forever. <span className="sup">36</span>But no one knows
        the date and hour when the end will be--not even the angels. No, nor
        even God's Son. Only the Father knows.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>"The world will be at ease--banquets
        and parties and weddings--just as it was in Noah's time before the
        sudden coming of the flood; <span className="sup">39</span>people
        wouldn't believe what was going to happen until the flood actually
        arrived and took them all away. So shall my coming be.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>"Two men will be working together in the
        fields, and one will be taken, the other left.
        <span className="sup">41</span>Two women will be going about their
        household tasks; one will be taken, the other left.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>"So be prepared, for you don't know what
        day your Lord is coming.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"Just as a man can prevent trouble from
        thieves by keeping watch for them, <span className="sup">44</span>so you
        can avoid trouble by always being ready for my unannounced return.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>"Are you a wise and faithful servant of
        the Lord? Have I given you the task of managing my household, to feed my
        children day by day? <span className="sup">46</span>Blessings on you if
        I return and find you faithfully doing your work.
        <span className="sup">47</span>I will put such faithful ones in charge
        of everything I own!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>"But if you are evil and say to yourself,
        'My Lord won't be coming for a while,' <span className="sup">49</span>
        and begin oppressing your fellow servants, partying and getting drunk,
        <span className="sup">50</span>your Lord will arrive unannounced and
        unexpected, <span className="sup">51</span>and severely whip you and
        send you off to the judgment of the hypocrites; there will be weeping
        and gnashing of teeth.
