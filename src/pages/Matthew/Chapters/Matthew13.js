      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Later that same day, Jesus left the house and went down to the shore,
        <span className="sup">2,3</span>where an immense crowd soon gathered. He
        got into a boat and taught from it while the people listened on the
        beach. He used many illustrations such as this one in his sermon:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "A farmer was sowing grain in his fields. <span className="sup">4</span>
        As he scattered the seed across the ground, some fell beside a path, and
        the birds came and ate it. <span className="sup">5</span>And some fell
        on rocky soil where there was little depth of earth; the plants sprang
        up quickly enough in the shallow soil, <span className="sup">6</span>but
        the hot sun soon scorched them and they withered and died, for they had
        so little root. <span className="sup">7</span>Other seeds fell among
        thorns, and the thorns choked out the tender blades.
        <span className="sup">8</span>But some fell on good soil, and produced a
        crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as he had
        planted. <span className="sup">9</span>If you have ears, listen!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>His disciples came and asked him, "Why do
        you always use these hard-to-understand illustrations?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Then he explained to them that only they
        were permitted to understand about the Kingdom of Heaven, and others
        were not.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>"For to him who has will more be
        given,"
        <span>he told them, </span>"and he will have great plenty; but from him
        who has not, even the little he has will be taken away. That is why I
        use these illustrations, so people will hear and see but not understand.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">'They hear, but don't understand;</p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">they look, but don't see!</p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        <span className="sup">15</span>For their hearts are fat and heavy, and
        their ears are dull, and they have closed their eyes in sleep,
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        <span className="sup">16</span>so they won't see and hear and understand
        and turn to God again, and let me heal them.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
        <span className="sup">17</span>Many a prophet and godly man has longed
        to see what you have seen, and hear what you have heard, but couldn't.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"Now here is the explanation of the story
        I told about the farmer planting grain: <span className="sup">19</span>
        The hard path where some of the seeds fell represents the heart of a
        person who hears the Good News about the Kingdom and doesn't understand
        it; then Satan comes and snatches away the seeds from his heart.
        <span className="sup">20</span>The shallow, rocky soil represents the
        heart of a man who hears the message and receives it with real joy,
        <span className="sup">21</span>but he doesn't have much depth in his
        life, and the seeds don't root very deeply, and after a while when
        trouble comes, or persecution begins because of his beliefs, his
        enthusiasm fades, and he drops out. <span className="sup">22</span>The
        ground covered with thistles represents a man who hears the message, but
        the cares of this life and his longing for money choke out God's Word,
        and he does less and less for God. <span className="sup">23</span>The
        good ground represents the heart of a man who listens to the message and
        understands it and goes out and brings thirty, sixty, or even a hundred
        others into the Kingdom."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Here is another illustration Jesus used:
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer sowing good seed in his field;{' '}
          <span className="sup">25</span>but one night as he slept, his enemy
          came and sowed thistles among the wheat.
          <span className="sup">26</span>When the crop began to grow, the
          thistles grew too.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"The farmer's men came and told him,
        'Sir, the field where you planted that choice seed is full of thistles!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"'An enemy has done it,' he exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">"'Shall we pull out the thistles?' they asked.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"'No,' he replied. 'You'll hurt the wheat
        if you do. <span className="sup">30</span>Let both grow together until
        the harvest, and I will tell the reapers to sort out the thistles and
        burn them, and put the wheat in the barn.'"
        <span>
          <span className="sup">31,32</span>Here is another of his
          illustrations:
        </span>
        "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a tiny mustard seed planted in a field.
        It is the smallest of all seeds, but becomes the largest of plants, and
        grows into a tree where birds can come and find shelter."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>He also used this example:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "The Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a woman making bread. She
        takes a measure of flour and mixes in the yeast until it permeates every
        part of the dough."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34,35</span>Jesus constantly used these
        illustrations when speaking to the crowds. In fact, because the prophets
        said that he would use so many, he never spoke to them without at least
        one illustration. For it had been prophesied, "I will talk in parables;
        I will explain mysteries hidden since the beginning of time."
        <small>Psalm 78:2</small> <span className="sup">36</span>Then, leaving
        the crowds outside, he went into the house. His disciples asked him to
        explain to them the illustration of the thistles and the wheat.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"All right," <span>he said, </span>"I am
        the farmer who sows the choice seed. <span className="sup">38</span>The
        field is the world, and the seed represents the people of the Kingdom;
        the thistles are the people belonging to Satan.
        <span className="sup">39</span>The enemy who sowed the thistles among
        the wheat is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world, and the
        reapers are the angels.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>"Just as in this story the thistles are
        separated and burned, so shall it be at the end of the world:
        <span className="sup">41</span>I will send my angels and they will
        separate out of the Kingdom every temptation and all who are evil,
        <span className="sup">42</span>and throw them into the furnace and burn
        them. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
        <span className="sup">43</span>Then the godly shall shine as the sun in
        their Father's Kingdom. Let those with ears, listen!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>"The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure
        a man discovered in a field. In his excitement, he sold everything he
        owned to get enough money to buy the field--and get the treasure, too!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a
        pearl merchant on the lookout for choice pearls.{' '}
        <span className="sup">46</span>He discovered a real bargain--a pearl of
        great value--and sold everything he owned to purchase it!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">47,48</span>"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can be
        illustrated by a fisherman--he casts a net into the water and gathers in
        fish of every kind, valuable and worthless. When the net is full, he
        drags it up onto the beach and sits down and sorts out the edible ones
        into crates and throws the others away. <span className="sup">49</span>
        That is the way it will be at the end of the world--the angels will come
        and separate the wicked people from the godly,
        <span className="sup">50</span>casting the wicked into the fire; there
        shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <span className="sup">51</span>
        Do you understand?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Yes," they said, "we do."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>Then he added,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Those experts in Jewish law who are now my disciples have double
          treasures--from the Old Testament as well as from the New!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">53,54</span>When Jesus had finished giving these
        illustrations, he returned to his home town, Nazareth in Galilee, and
        taught there in the synagogue and astonished everyone with his wisdom
        and his miracles.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>"How is this possible?" the people
        exclaimed. "He's just a carpenter's son, and we know Mary his mother and
        his brothers--James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas.
        <span className="sup">56</span>And his sisters--they all live here. How
        can he be so great?" <span className="sup">57</span>And they became
        angry with him!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own country, and among
          his own people!"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">58</span>And so he did only a few great miracles
        there, because of their unbelief.
      </p>
