      <p className="quote">
        Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John to the top
        of a high and lonely hill, <span className="sup">2</span>and as they
        watched, his appearance changed so that his face shone like the sun and
        his clothing became dazzling white.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Suddenly Moses and Elijah appeared and
        were talking with him. <span className="sup">4</span>Peter blurted out,
        "Sir, it's wonderful that we can be here! If you want me to, I'll make
        three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>But even as he said it, a bright cloud
        came over them, and a voice from the cloud said, " <em>This</em> is my
        beloved Son, and I am wonderfully pleased with him. Obey <em>him.</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>At this the disciples fell face downward
        to the ground, terribly frightened. <span className="sup">7</span>Jesus
        came over and touched them.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Get up," <span>he said, </span>"don't be afraid."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>And when they looked, only Jesus was with
        them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>As they were going down the mountain,
        Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after
        he had risen from the dead.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>His disciples asked, "Why do the Jewish
        leaders insist Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "They are right. Elijah must come and set everything in order.
          <span className="sup">12</span>And, in fact, he has already come, but
          he wasn't recognized, and was badly mistreated by many. And I, the
          Messiah, shall also suffer at their hands."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then the disciples realized he was
        speaking of John the Baptist.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>When they arrived at the bottom of the
        hill, a huge crowd was waiting for them. A man came and knelt before
        Jesus and said, <span className="sup">15</span>"Sir, have mercy on my
        son, for he is mentally deranged, and in great trouble, for he often
        falls into the fire or into the water; <span className="sup">16</span>so
        I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't cure him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Oh, you stubborn, faithless people! How long shall I bear with you?
          Bring him here to me."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">18</span>Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy
        and it left him, and from that moment the boy was well.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Afterwards the disciples asked Jesus
        privately, "Why couldn't we cast that demon out?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"Because of your little faith,"
        <span>Jesus told them. </span>"For if you had faith even as small as a
        tiny mustard seed you could say to this mountain, 'Move!' and it would
        go far away. Nothing would be impossible.{' '}
        <span className="sup">21</span>But this kind of demon won't leave unless
        you have prayed and gone without food."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>One day while they were still in
        Galilee, Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am going to be betrayed into the power of those who will kill me,
          and on the third day afterwards I will be brought back to life again."
        </span>
        And the disciples' hearts were filled with sorrow and dread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>On their arrival in Capernaum, the Temple
        tax collectors came to Peter and asked him, "Doesn't your master pay
        taxes?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Of course he does," Peter replied.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then he went into the house to talk to Jesus about it, but before he had
        a chance to speak, Jesus asked him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "What do you think, Peter? Do kings levy assessments against their own
          people, or against conquered foreigners?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26,27</span>"Against the foreigners," Peter
        replied.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Well, then," <span>Jesus said, </span>"the citizens are free! However,
        we don't want to offend them, so go down to the shore and throw in a
        line, and open the mouth of the first fish you catch. You will find a
        coin to cover the taxes for both of us; take it and pay them."
