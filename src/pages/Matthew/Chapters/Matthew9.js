      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        So Jesus climbed into a boat and went across the lake to Capernaum, his
        home town.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Soon some men brought him a paralyzed boy
        on a mat. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick boy,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Cheer up, son! For I have forgiven your sins!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"Blasphemy! This man is saying he is God!"
        exclaimed some of the religious leaders to themselves.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>Jesus knew what they were thinking and
        asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why are thinking such evil thoughts? <span className="sup">5,6</span>
          I, the Messiah, have the authority on earth to forgive sins. But talk
          is cheap--anybody could say that. So I'll prove it to you by healing
          this man."
          <span>Then, turning to the paralyzed man, he commanded, </span>"Pick
          up your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>And the boy jumped up and left!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>A chill of fear swept through the crowd as
        they saw this happen right before their eyes. How they praised God for
        giving such authority to a man!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>As Jesus was going on down the road, he
        saw a tax collector, Matthew, sitting at a tax collection booth.
        <span class="jesus">"Come and be my disciple,"</span> Jesus said to him,
        and Matthew jumped up and went along with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Later, as Jesus and his disciples were
        eating dinner [at Matthew's house], there were many notorious swindlers
        there as guests!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>The Pharisees were indignant. "Why does
        your teacher associate with me like that?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Because people who are well don't need a doctor! It's the sick people
          who do!"
          <span>
            was Jesus' reply. <span className="sup">13</span>Then he added,{' '}
          </span>
          "Now go away and learn the meaning of this verse of Scripture,
        </span>

      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        'It isn't your sacrifices and your gifts I want--I want you to be
        merciful.' <small>Hosea 6:6</small>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        For I have come to urge sinners, not the self-righteous, back to God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>One day the disciples of John the Baptist
        came to Jesus and asked him, "Why don't your disciples fast as we do and
        as the Pharisees do?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"Should the bridegroom's friends mourn
        and go without food while he is with them?" <span>Jesus asked.</span>{' '}
        "But the time is coming when I will be taken from them. Time enough then
        for them to refuse to eat.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "And who would patch an old garment with unshrunk cloth? For the patch
          would tear away and make the hole worse.
          <span className="sup">17</span>And who would use old wineskins to
          store new wine? For the old skins would burst with the pressure, and
          the wine would be spilled and the skins ruined. Only new wineskins are
          used to store new wine. That way both are preserved."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>As he was saying this, the rabbi of the
        local synagogue came and worshiped him. "My little daughter has just
        died," he said, "but you can bring her back to life again if you will
        only come and touch her."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>As Jesus and the disciples were going to
        the rabbi's home, <span className="sup">20</span>a woman who had been
        sick for twelve years with internal bleeding came up behind him and
        touched a tassel of his robe, <span className="sup">21</span>for she
        thought, "If I only touch him, I will be healed."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Jesus turned around and spoke to her.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Daughter," <span>he said, </span>"all is well! Your faith has healed
          you."
        </span>
        And the woman was well from that moment.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>When Jesus arrived at the rabbi's home
        and saw the noisy crowds and heard the funeral music,
        <span className="sup">24</span>he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Get them out, for the little girl isn't dead; she is only sleeping!"
        </span>
        Then how they all scoffed and sneered at him!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>When the crowd was finally outside, Jesus
        went in where the little girl was lying and took her by the hand, and
        she jumped up and was all right again! <span className="sup">26</span>
        The report of this wonderful miracle swept the entire countryside.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>As Jesus was leaving her home, two blind
        men followed along behind, shouting, "O Son of King David, have mercy on
        us."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>They went right into the house where he
        was staying, and Jesus asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Do you believe I can make you see?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Yes, Lord," they told him, "we do."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Then he touched their eyes and said,
        <span class="jesus">"Because of your faith it will happen."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>And suddenly they could see! Jesus
        sternly warned them not to tell anyone about it,{' '}
        <span className="sup">31</span>but instead they spread his fame all over
        the town.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Leaving that place, Jesus met a man who
        couldn't speak because a demon was inside him.
        <span className="sup">33</span>So Jesus cast out the demon, and
        instantly the man could talk. How the crowds marveled! "Never in all our
        lives have we seen anything like this," they exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>But the Pharisees said, "The reason he
        can cast out demons is that he is demon-possessed himself--possessed by
        Satan, the demon king!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Jesus traveled around through all the
        cities and villages of that area, teaching in the Jewish synagogues and
        announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And wherever he went he
        healed people of every sort of illness. <span className="sup">36</span>
        And what pity he felt for the crowds that came, because their problems
        were so great and they didn't know what to do or where to go for help.
        They were like sheep without a shepherd.

      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"The harvest is so great, and the workers
        are so few,"
        <span>
          he told his disciples. <span className="sup">38</span>{' '}
        </span>
        "So pray to the one in charge of the harvesting, and ask him to recruit
        more workers for his harvest fields."
