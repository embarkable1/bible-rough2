      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, and were near the town
        of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of them into the
        village ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Just as you enter,"
        <span>he said, </span>"you will see a donkey tied there, with its colt
        beside it. Untie them and bring them here.{' '}
        <span className="sup">3</span>If anyone asks you what you are doing,
        just say, 'The Master needs them,' and there will be no trouble."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>This was done to fulfill the ancient
        prophecy,
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Tell Jerusalem her King is coming to her,
        riding humbly on a donkey's colt!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>The two disciples did as Jesus said,
        <span className="sup">7</span>and brought the animals to him and threw
        their garments over the colt for him to ride on.{' '}
        <span className="sup">8</span>And some in the crowd threw down their
        coats along the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the
        trees and spread them out before him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then the crowds surged on ahead and
        pressed along behind, shouting, "God bless King David's Son!" . . .
        "God's Man is here! . . . Bless him, Lord!" . . . "Praise God in highest
        heaven!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>The entire city of Jerusalem was stirred
        as he entered. "Who is this?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And the crowds replied, "It's Jesus, the
        prophet from Nazareth up in Galilee."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Jesus went into the Temple, drove out the
        merchants, and knocked over the money-changers' tables and the stalls of
        those selling doves.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"The Scriptures say my Temple is a place
        of prayer," <span>he declared, </span>"but you have turned it into a den
        of thieves."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>And now the blind and crippled came to
        him and he healed them there in the Temple.{' '}
        <span className="sup">15</span>But when the chief priests and other
        Jewish leaders saw these wonderful miracles, and heard even the little
        children in the Temple shouting, "God bless the Son of David," they were
        disturbed and indignant and asked him, "Do you hear what these children
        are saying?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"Yes," <span>Jesus replied. </span>
        "Didn't you ever read the Scriptures? For they say, 'Even little babies
        shall praise him!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Then he returned to Bethany, where he
        stayed overnight.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>In the morning, as he was returning to
        Jerusalem, he was hungry, <span className="sup">19</span>and noticed a
        fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs,
        but there were only leaves. Then he said to it,
        <span class="jesus">"Never bear fruit again!" </span>And soon the fig
        tree withered up.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>The disciples were utterly amazed and
        asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Truly, if you have faith, and don't doubt, you can do things like
          this and much more. You can even say to this Mount of Olives, 'Move
          over into the ocean,' and it will. <span className="sup">22</span>You
          can get anything-- <em>anything</em> you ask for in prayer--if you
          believe."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>When he had returned to the Temple and
        was teaching, the chief priests and other Jewish leaders came up to him
        and demanded to know by whose authority he had thrown out the merchants
        the day before.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"I'll tell you if you answer one question
        first," <span>Jesus replied. </span>
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Was John the Baptist sent from God, or
        not?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        They talked it over among themselves. "If we say, 'From God,'" they
        said, "then he will ask why we didn't believe what John said.
        <span className="sup">26</span>And if we deny that God sent him, we'll
        be mobbed, for the crowd all think he was a prophet."
        <span className="sup">27</span>So they finally replied, "We don't know!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">"Then I won't answer your question either."</span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"But what do you think about this? A man
        with two sons told the older boy, 'Son, go out and work on the farm
        today.'
        <span className="sup">29</span>'I won't,' he answered, but later he
        changed his mind and went. <span className="sup">30</span>Then the
        father told the youngest, 'You go!' and he said, 'Yes, sir, I will.' But
        he didn't.
        <span className="sup">31</span>Which of the two was obeying his father?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">They replied, "The first, of course."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus explained his meaning:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Surely evil men and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom before you
          do. <span className="sup">32</span>For John the Baptist told you to
          repent and turn to God, and you wouldn't, while very evil men and
          prostitutes did. And even when you saw this happening, you refused to
          repent, and so you couldn't believe."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"Now listen to this story: A certain
        landowner planted a vineyard with a hedge around it, and built a
        platform for the watchman, then leased the vineyard to some farmers on a
        sharecrop basis, and went away to live in another country.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"At the time of the grape harvest he sent
        his agents to the farmers to collect his share.
        <span className="sup">35</span>But the farmers attacked his men, beat
        one, killed one and stoned another.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"Then he sent a larger group of his men
        to collect for him, but the results were the same.
        <span className="sup">37</span>Finally the owner sent his son, thinking
        they would surely respect him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"But when these farmers saw the son
        coming they said among themselves, 'Here comes the heir to this estate;
        come on, let's kill him and get it for ourselves!'
        <span className="sup">39</span>So they dragged him out of the vineyard
        and killed him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>"When the owner returns, what do you
        think he will do to those farmers?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>The Jewish leaders replied, "He will put
        the wicked men to a horrible death, and lease the vineyard to others who
        will pay him promptly."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>Then Jesus asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Didn't you ever read in the Scriptures: 'The stone rejected by the
          builders has been made the honored cornerstone; how remarkable! what
          an amazing thing the Lord has done'?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"What I mean is that the Kingdom of God
        shall be taken away from you, and given to a nation that will give God
        his share of the crop. <span className="sup">44</span>All who stumble on
        this rock of truth shall be broken, but those it falls on will be
        scattered as dust."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>When the chief priests and other Jewish
        leaders realized that Jesus was talking about them--that they were the
        farmers in his story-- <span className="sup">46</span>they wanted to get
        rid of him, but were afraid to try because of the crowds, for they
        accepted Jesus as a prophet.
