      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus told several other stories to show what the Kingdom of Heaven is
        like.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "For instance," <span>he said, </span>"it can be illustrated by the
        story of a king who prepared a great wedding dinner for his son.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Many guests were invited, and when the
        banquet was ready he sent messengers to notify everyone that it was time
        to come. But all refused! <span className="sup">4</span>So he sent other
        servants to tell them, 'Everything is ready and the roast is in the
        oven. Hurry!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"But the guests he had invited merely
        laughed and went on about their business, one to his farm, another to
        his store;
        <span className="sup">6</span>others beat up his messengers and treated
        them shamefully, even killing some of them.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Then the angry king sent out his army and
        destroyed the murderers and burned their city.
        <span className="sup">8</span>And he said to his servants, 'The wedding
        feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren't worthy of the honor.
        <span className="sup">9</span>Now go out to the street corners and
        invite everyone you see.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"So the servants did, and brought in all
        they could find, good and bad alike; and the banquet hall was filled
        with guests. <span className="sup">11</span>But when the king came in to
        meet the guests he noticed a man who wasn't wearing the wedding robe
        [provided for him].
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"'Friend,' he asked, 'how does it happen
        that you are here without a wedding robe?' And the man had no reply.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"Then the king said to his aides, 'Bind
        him hand and foot and throw him out into the outer darkness where there
        is weeping and gnashing of teeth.' <span className="sup">14</span>For
        many are called, but few are chosen."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then the Pharisees met together to try to
        think of some way to trap Jesus into saying something for which they
        could arrest him. <span className="sup">16</span>They decided to send
        some of their men along with the Herodians to ask him this question:
        "Sir, we know you are very honest and teach the truth regardless of the
        consequences, without fear or favor. <span className="sup">17</span>Now
        tell us, is it right to pay taxes to the Roman government or not?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>But Jesus saw what they were after.
        <span class="jesus">
          "You hypocrites!" <span>he exclaimed. </span>"Who are you trying to
          fool with your trick questions? <span className="sup">19</span>Here,
          show me a coin."
        </span>
        And they handed him a penny.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"Whose picture is stamped on it?"
        <span>he asked them. </span>"And whose name is this beneath the
        picture?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Caesar's," they replied.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Well, then," <span>he said, </span>"give it to Caesar if it is his, and
        give God everything that belongs to God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>His reply surprised and baffled them and
        they went away.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>But that same day some of the Sadducees,
        who say there is no resurrection after death, came to him and asked,
        <span className="sup">24</span>"Sir, Moses said that if a man died
        without children, his brother should marry the widow and their children
        would get all the dead man's property. <span className="sup">25</span>
        Well, we had among us a family of seven brothers. The first of these men
        married and then died, without children, so his widow became the second
        brother's wife. <span className="sup">26</span>This brother also died
        without children, and the wife was passed to the next brother, and so on
        until she had been the wife of each of them.{' '}
        <span className="sup">27</span>And then she also died.{' '}
        <span className="sup">28</span>So whose wife will she be in the
        resurrection? For she was the wife of all seven of them!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Your error is caused by your ignorance of the Scriptures and of God's
          power! <span className="sup">30</span>For in the resurrection there is
          no marriage; everyone is as the angels in heaven.
          <span className="sup">31</span>But now, as to whether there is a
          resurrection of the dead--don't you ever read the Scriptures? Don't
          you realize that God was speaking directly to you when he said,
          <span className="sup">32</span>'I <em>am</em> the God of Abraham,
          Isaac, and Jacob'? So God is not the God of the dead, but of the
          <em>living.</em>"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>The crowds were profoundly impressed by
        his answers-- <span className="sup">34,35</span>but not the Pharisees!
        When they heard that he had routed the Sadducees with his reply, they
        thought up a fresh question of their own to ask him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        One of them, a lawyer, spoke up: <span className="sup">36</span>"Sir,
        which is the most important command in the laws of Moses?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind.'
          <span className="sup">38,39</span>This is the first and greatest
          commandment. The second most important is similar: 'Love your neighbor
          as much as you love yourself.' <span className="sup">40</span>All the
          other commandments and all the demands of the prophets stem from these
          two laws and are fulfilled if you obey them. Keep only these and you
          will find that you are obeying all the others."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then, surrounded by the Pharisees, he
        asked them a question: <span className="sup">42</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" </span>
        "The son of David," they replied.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"Then why does David, speaking under the
        inspiration of the Holy Spirit, call him 'Lord'?"
        <span>Jesus asked. </span>"For David said,
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        <span className="sup">44</span>'God said to my Lord, Sit at my right
        hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Since David called him 'Lord,' how can he
        be merely his son?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>They had no answer. And after that no one
        dared ask him any more questions.
