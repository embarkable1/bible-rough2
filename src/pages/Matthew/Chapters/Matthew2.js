      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem, in Judea, during the reign of
        King Herod.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        At about that time some astrologers from eastern lands arrived in
        Jerusalem, asking, <span className="sup">2</span>"Where is the newborn
        King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in far-off eastern lands,
        and have come to worship him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>King Herod was deeply disturbed by their
        question, and all Jerusalem was filled with rumors.
        <span className="sup">4</span>He called a meeting of the Jewish
        religious leaders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Did the prophets tell us where the Messiah would be born?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Yes, in Bethlehem," they said, "for this
        is what the prophet Micah <small>Micah 5:2</small> wrote:
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">6</span>'O little town of Bethlehem, you are not
        just an unimportant Judean village, for a Governor shall rise from you
        to rule my people Israel.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Then Herod sent a private message to the
        astrologers, asking them to come to see him; at this meeting he found
        out from them the exact time when they first saw the star. Then he told
        them, <span className="sup">8</span>"Go to Bethlehem and search for the
        child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and
        worship him too!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>After this interview the astrologers
        started out again. And look! The star appeared to them again, standing
        over Bethlehem. <span className="sup">10</span>Their joy knew no bounds!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Entering the house where the baby and
        Mary his mother were, they threw themselves down before him,
        worshipping. Then they opened their presents and gave him gold,
        frankincense and myrrh. <span className="sup">12</span>But when they
        returned to their own land, they didn't go through Jerusalem to report
        to Herod, for God had warned them in a dream to go home another way.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>After they were gone, an angel of the
        Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up and flee to Egypt with the
        baby and his mother," the angel said, "and stay there until I tell you
        to return, for King Herod is going to try to kill the child."
        <span className="sup">14</span>That same night he left for Egypt with
        Mary and the baby, <span className="sup">15</span>and stayed there until
        King Herod's death. This fulfilled the prophet's prediction,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        "I have called my Son from Egypt." <small>Hosea 11:1</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Herod was furious when he learned that
        the astrologers had disobeyed him. Sending soldiers to Bethlehem, he
        ordered them to kill every baby boy two years old and under, both in the
        town and on the nearby farms, for the astrologers had told him the star
        first appeared to them two years before. <span className="sup">17</span>
        This brutal action of Herod's fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah,
        <small>Jeremiah 31:15</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"Screams of anguish come from Ramah,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">Weeping unrestrained;</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Rachel weeping for her children,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Uncomforted--</p>
      <p className="quote__long">For they are dead."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>When Herod died, an angel of the Lord
        appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, and told him,
        <span className="sup">20</span>"Get up and take the baby and his mother
        back to Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>So he returned immediately to Israel with
        Jesus and his mother. <span className="sup">22</span>But on the way he
        was frightened to learn that the new king was Herod's son, Archelaus.
        Then, in another dream, he was warned not to go to Judea, so they went
        to Galilee instead, <span className="sup">23</span>and lived in
        Nazareth. This fulfilled the prediction of the prophets concerning the
        Messiah,

      <p className="quote__long">"He shall be called a Nazarene."</p>
