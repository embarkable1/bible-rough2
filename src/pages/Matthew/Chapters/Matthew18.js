      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        About that time the disciples came to Jesus to ask which of them would
        be greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Jesus called a small child over to him and
        set the little fellow down among them, <span className="sup">3</span>and
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Unless you turn to God from your sins and become as little children,
          you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.
          <span className="sup">4</span>Therefore anyone who humbles himself as
          this little child, is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
          <span className="sup">5</span>And any of you who welcomes a little
          child like this because you are mine, is welcoming me and caring for
          me.
          <span className="sup">6</span>But if any of you causes one of these
          little ones who trusts in me to lose his faith, it would be better for
          you to have a rock tied to your neck and be thrown into the sea.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Woe upon the world for all its evils.
        Temptation to do wrong is inevitable, but woe to the man who does the
        tempting. <span className="sup">8</span>So if your hand or foot causes
        you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Better to enter heaven
        crippled than to be in hell with both of your hands and feet.
        <span className="sup">9</span>And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge
        it out and throw it away. Better to enter heaven with one eye than to be
        in hell with two.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"Beware that you don't look down upon a
        single one of these little children. For I tell you that in heaven their
        angels have constant access to my Father.{' '}
        <span className="sup">11</span>And I, the Messiah, came to save the
        lost.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"If a man has a hundred sheep, and one
        wanders away and is lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the
        ninety-nine others and go out into the hills to search for the lost one?
        <span className="sup">13</span>And if he finds it, he will rejoice over
        it more than over the ninety-nine others safe at home!
        <span className="sup">14</span>Just so, it is not my Father's will that
        even one of these little ones should perish.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"If a brother sins against you, go to him
        privately and confront him with his fault. If he listens and confesses
        it, you have won back a brother. <span className="sup">16</span>But if
        not, then take one or two others with you and go back to him again,
        proving everything you say by these witnesses.{' '}
        <span className="sup">17</span>If he still refuses to listen, then take
        your case to the church, and if the church's verdict favors you, but he
        won't accept it, then the church should excommunicate him.{' '}
        <span className="sup">18</span>And I tell you this--whatever you bind on
        earth is bound in heaven, and whatever you free on earth will be freed
        in heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"I also tell you this--if two of you
        agree down here on earth concerning anything you ask for, my Father in
        heaven will do it for you. <span className="sup">20</span>For where two
        or three gather together because they are mine, I will be right there
        among them."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then Peter came to him and asked, "Sir,
        how often should I forgive a brother who sins against me? Seven times?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"No!" <span>Jesus replied, </span>
        "seventy times seven!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"The Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to
        a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date.
        <span className="sup">24</span>In the process, one of his debtors was
        brought in who owed him $10,000,000! <span className="sup">25</span>He
        couldn't pay, so the king ordered him sold for the debt, also his wife
        and children and everything he had.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But the man fell down before the king,
        his face in the dust, and said, 'Oh, sir, be patient with me and I will
        pay it all.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Then the king was filled with pity for
        him and released him and forgave his debt.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"But when the man left the king, he went
        to a man who owed him $2,000 and grabbed him by the throat and demanded
        instant payment.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"Then man fell down before him and begged
        him to give him a little time. 'Be patient and I will pay it,' he pled.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"But his creditor wouldn't wait. He had
        the man arrested and jailed until the debt would be paid in full.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Then the man's friends went to the king
        and told him what had happened. <span className="sup">32</span>And the
        king called before him the man he had forgiven and said, 'You
        evil-hearted wretch! Here I forgave you all that tremendous debt, just
        because you asked me to-- <span className="sup">33</span>shouldn't you
        have mercy on others, just as I had mercy on you?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Then the angry king sent the man to the
        torture chamber until he had paid every last penny due.
        <span className="sup">35</span>So shall my heavenly Father do to you if
        you refuse to truly forgive your brothers."
