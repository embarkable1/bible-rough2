      <h3>Chapter 25</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of ten
        bridesmaids who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom.
        <span className="sup">2,3,4</span>But only five of them were wise enough
        to fill their lamps with oil, while the other five were foolish and
        forgot.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>"So, when the bridegroom was delayed,
        they lay down to rest until midnight, when they were roused by the
        shout, 'The bridegroom is coming! Come out and welcome him!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7,8</span>"All the girls jumped up and trimmed
        their lamps. Then the five who hadn't any oil begged the others to share
        with them, for their lamps were going out.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"But the others replied, 'We haven't
        enough. Go instead to the shops and buy some for yourselves.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"But while they were gone, the bridegroom
        came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast,
        and the door was locked.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"Later, when the other five returned,
        they stood outside, calling, 'Sir, open the door for us!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"But he called back, 'Go away! It is too
        late!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"So stay awake and be prepared, for you
        do not know the date or moment of my return.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can be
        illustrated by the story of a man going into another country, who called
        together his servants and loaned them money to invest for him while he
        was gone.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"He gave $5,000 to one, $2,000 to
        another, and $1,000 to the last--dividing it in proportion to their
        abilities--and then left on his trip. <span className="sup">16</span>The
        man who received the $5,000 began immediately to buy and sell with it
        and soon earned another $5,000. <span className="sup">17</span>The man
        with $2,000 went right to work, too, and earned another $2,000.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"But the man who received the $1,000 dug
        a hole in the ground and hid the money for safekeeping.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"After a long time their master returned
        from his trip and called them to him to account for his money.
        <span className="sup">20</span>The man to whom he had entrusted the
        $5,000 brought him $10,000.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"His master praised him for good work.
        'You have been faithful in handling this small amount,' he told him, 'so
        now I will give you many more responsibilities. Begin the joyous tasks I
        have assigned to you.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"Next came the man who had received the
        $2,000, with the report, 'Sir, you gave me $2,000 to use, and I have
        doubled it.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"'Good work,' his master said. 'You are a
        good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over this small
        amount, so now I will give you much more.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24,25</span>"Then the man with the $1,000 came and
        said, 'Sir, I knew you were a hard man, and I was afraid you would rob
        me of what I earned, so I hid your money in the earth and here it is!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But his master replied, 'Wicked man!
        Lazy slave! Since you knew I would demand your profit,
        <span className="sup">27</span>you should at least have put my money
        into the bank so I could have some interest.{' '}
        <span className="sup">28</span>Take the money from this man and give it
        to the man with the $10,000.
        <span className="sup">29</span>For the man who uses well what he is
        given shall be given more, and he shall have abundance. But from the man
        who is unfaithful, even what little responsibility he has shall be taken
        from him. <span className="sup">30</span>And throw the useless servant
        out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"But when I, the Messiah, shall come in
        my glory, and all the angels with me, then I shall sit upon my throne of
        glory. <span className="sup">32</span>And all the nations shall be
        gathered before me. And I will separate the people as a shepherd
        separates the sheep from the goats, <span className="sup">33</span>and
        place the sheep at my right hand, and the goats at my left.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Then I, the King, shall say to those at
        my right, 'Come blessed of my Father, into the Kingdom prepared for you
        from the founding of the world. <span className="sup">35</span>For I was
        hungry and you fed me; I was thirsty and you gave me water; I was a
        stranger and you invited me into your homes;
        <span className="sup">36</span>naked and you clothed me; sick and in
        prison, and you visited me.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"Then these righteous ones will reply,
        'Sir, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give
        you anything to drink? <span className="sup">38</span>Or a stranger, and
        help you? Or naked, and clothe you? <span className="sup">39</span>When
        did we ever see you sick, or in prison, and visit you?'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>"And I, the King, will tell them, 'When
        you did it to these my brothers you were doing it to me!'
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then I will turn to those on my left and
        say, 'Away with you, you cursed ones, into the eternal fire prepared for
        the devil and his demons. <span className="sup">42</span>For I was
        hungry and you wouldn't feed me; thirsty, and you wouldn't give me
        anything to drink; <span className="sup">43</span>a stranger, and you
        refused me hospitality; naked, and you wouldn't clothe me; sick, and in
        prison, and you didn't visit me.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>"Then they will reply, 'Lord, when did we
        ever see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in
        prison, and not help you?'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>"And I will answer, 'When you refused to
        help the least of these my brothers, you were refusing help to me.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>"And they shall go away into eternal
        punishment; but the righteous into everlasting life."
