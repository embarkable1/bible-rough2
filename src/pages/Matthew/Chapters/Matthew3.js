      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        While they were living in Nazareth, John the Baptist began preaching out
        in the Judean wilderness. His constant theme was,
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Turn from your sins . . . turn to God . .
        . for the Kingdom of Heaven is coming soon."
        <span className="sup">3</span>Isaiah the prophet had told about John's
        ministry centuries before! He had written,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        "I hear <small>Isaiah 40:3</small> a shout from the wilderness, 'Prepare
        a road for the Lord--straighten out the path where he will walk.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>John's clothing was woven from camel's
        hair and he wore a leather belt; his food was locusts and wild honey.
        <span className="sup">5</span>People from Jerusalem and from all over
        the Jordan Valley, and, in fact, from every section of Judea went out to
        the wilderness to hear him preach, <span className="sup">6</span>and
        when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>But when he saw many Pharisees and
        Sadducees coming to be baptized, he denounced them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "You sons of snakes!" he warned. "Who said that you could escape the
        coming wrath of God? <span className="sup">8</span>Before being
        baptized, prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds.
        <span className="sup">9</span>Don't try to get by as you are, thinking,
        'We are safe for we are Jews--descendants of Abraham.' That proves
        nothing. God can change these stones here into Jews!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"And even now the axe of God's judgment
        is poised to chop down every unproductive tree. They will be chopped and
        burned.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"With water I baptize those who repent of
        their sins; but someone else is coming, far greater than I am, so great
        that I am not worthy to carry his shoes! He shall baptize you with the
        Holy Spirit and with fire. <span className="sup">12</span>He will
        separate the chaff from the grain, burning the chaff with never-ending
        fire, and storing away the grain."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then Jesus went from Galilee to the
        Jordan River to be baptized there by John.{' '}
        <span className="sup">14</span>John didn't want to do it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "This isn't proper," he said. "I am the one who needs to be baptized by
        you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Please do it, for I must do all that is right."
        </span>
        So then John baptized him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>After his baptism, as soon as Jesus came
        up out of the water, the heavens were opened to him and he saw the
        Spirit of God coming down in the form of a dove.{' '}
        <span className="sup">17</span>And a voice from heaven said, "This is my
        beloved Son, and I am wonderfully pleased with him."
