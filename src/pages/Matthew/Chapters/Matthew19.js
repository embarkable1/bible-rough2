      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        After Jesus had finished this address, he left Galilee and circled back
        to Judea from across the Jordan River. <span className="sup">2</span>
        Vast crowds followed him, and he healed their sick.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Some Pharisees came to interview him, and
        tried to trap him into saying something that would ruin him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Do you permit divorce?" they asked.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"Don't you read the Scriptures?"
        <span>he replied. </span>"In them it is written that at the beginning
        God created man and woman, <span className="sup">5,6</span>and that a
        man should leave his father and mother, and be forever united to his
        wife. The two shall become one--no longer two, but one! And no man may
        divorce what God has joined together."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Then, why," they asked, "did Moses say a
        man may divorce his wife by merely writing her a letter of dismissal?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus replied,{' '}
        </span>
        "Moses did that in recognition of your hard and evil hearts, but it was
        not what God had originally intended. <span className="sup">9</span>And
        I tell you this, that anyone who divorces his wife, except for
        fornication, and marries another, commits adultery."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Jesus' disciples then said to him, "If
        that is how it is, it is better not to marry!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"Not everyone can accept this statement,"
        <span>Jesus said. </span>"Only those whom God helps.
        <span className="sup">12</span>Some are born without the ability to
        marry, and some are disabled by men, and some refuse to marry for the
        sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone who can, accept my statement."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Little children were brought for Jesus to
        lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples scolded those who
        brought them. "Don't bother him," they said.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">14</span>But Jesus said,{' '}
        </span>
        "Let the little children come to me, and don't prevent them. For of such
        is the Kingdom of Heaven."
        <span>
          <span className="sup">15</span>And he put his hands on their heads and
          blessed them before he left.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Someone came to Jesus with this question:
        "Good master, what must I do to have eternal life?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"When you call me good you are calling me
        God," <span>Jesus replied, </span>"for God alone is truly good. But to
        answer your question, you can get to heaven if you keep the
        commandments."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"Which ones?" the man asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't kill, don't commit adultery, don't steal, don't lie,
          <span className="sup">19</span>honor your father and mother, and love
          your neighbor as yourself!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"I've always obeyed every one of them,"
        the youth replied. "What else must I do?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you want to be perfect, go and sell everything you have and give
          the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,
          follow me."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">22</span>But when the young man heard this, he
        went away sadly, for he was very rich.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then Jesus said to his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is almost impossible for a rich man to get into the Kingdom of
          Heaven. <span className="sup">24</span>I say it again--it is easier
          for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
          enter the Kingdom of God!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>This remark confounded the disciples.
        "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Jesus looked at them intently and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Humanly speaking, no one. But with God, everything is possible."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Then Peter said to him, "We left
        everything to follow you. What will we get out of it?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When I, the Messiah, shall sit upon my glorious throne in the
          Kingdom, you my disciples shall certainly sit on twelve thrones
          judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <span className="sup">29</span>
          And anyone who gives up his home, brothers, sisters, father, mother,
          wife, children, or property, to follow me, shall receive a hundred
          times as much in return, and shall have eternal life.
          <span className="sup">30</span>But many who are first now will be last
          then; and some who are last now will be first then."
