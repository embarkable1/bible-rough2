      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Take care! don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired, for then
        you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.
        <span className="sup">2</span>When you give a gift to a beggar, don't
        shout about it as the hypocrites do--blowing trumpets in the synagogues
        and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you in
        all earnestness, they have received all the reward they will ever get.
        <span className="sup">3</span>But when you do a kindness to someone, do
        it secretly--don't tell your left hand what your right hand is doing.
        <span className="sup">4</span>And your Father who knows all secrets will
        reward you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"And now about prayer. When you pray,
        don't be like the hypocrites who pretend piety by praying publicly on
        street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. Truly,
        that is all the reward they will ever get.{' '}
        <span className="sup">6</span>But when you pray, go away by yourself,
        all alone, and shut the door behind you and pray to your Father
        secretly, and your Father, who knows your secrets, will reward you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7,8</span>"Don't recite the same prayer over and
        over as the heathen do, who think prayers are answered only by repeating
        them again and again. Remember, your Father knows exactly what you need
        even before you ask him!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"Pray along these lines: 'Our Father in
        heaven, we honor your holy name. <span className="sup">10</span>We ask
        that your kingdom will come now. May your will be done here on earth,
        just as it is in heaven. <span className="sup">11</span>Give us our food
        again today, as usual, <span className="sup">12</span>and forgive us our
        sins, just as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
        <span className="sup">13</span>Don't bring us into temptation, but
        deliver us from the Evil One. Amen.' <span className="sup">14,15</span>
        Your heavenly Father will forgive you if you forgive those who sin
        against you; but if
        <em>you</em> refuse to forgive <em>them, he</em> will not forgive
        <em>you.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"And now about fasting. When you fast,
        declining your food for a spiritual purpose, don't do it publicly, as
        the hypocrites do, who try to look wan and disheveled so people will
        feel sorry for them. Truly, that is the only reward they will ever get.
        <span className="sup">17</span>But when you fast, put on festive
        clothing,
        <span className="sup">18</span>so that no one will suspect you are
        hungry, except your Father who knows every secret. And he will reward
        you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Don't store up treasures here on earth
        where they can erode away or may be stolen.{' '}
        <span className="sup">20</span>Store them in heaven where they will
        never lose their value, and are safe from thieves.{' '}
        <span className="sup">21</span>If your profits are in heaven your heart
        will be there too.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"If your eye is pure, there will be
        sunshine in your soul. <span className="sup">23</span>But if your eye is
        clouded with evil thoughts and desires, you are in deep spiritual
        darkness. And oh, how deep that darkness can be!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"You cannot serve two masters: God and
        money. For you will hate one and love the other, or else the other way
        around.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"So my counsel is: Don't worry about
        <em>things</em>--food, drink, and clothes. For you already have life and
        a body--and they are far more important than what to eat and wear.
        <span className="sup">26</span>Look at the birds! They don't worry about
        what to eat--they don't need to sow or reap or store up food--for your
        heavenly Father feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than
        they are. <span className="sup">27</span>Will all your worries add a
        single moment to your life?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"And why worry about your clothes? Look
        at the field lilies! They don't worry about theirs.
        <span className="sup">29</span>Yet King Solomon in all his glory was not
        clothed as beautifully as they. <span className="sup">30</span>And if
        God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and gone
        tomorrow, won't he more surely care for you, O men of little faith?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31,32</span>"So don't worry at all about having
        enough food and clothing. Why be like the heathen? For they take pride
        in all these things and are deeply concerned about them. But your
        heavenly Father already knows perfectly well that you need them,
        <span className="sup">33</span>and he will give them to you if you give
        him first place in your life and live as he wants you to.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"So don't be anxious about tomorrow. God
        will take care of your tomorrow too. Live one day at a time.
      </p>
