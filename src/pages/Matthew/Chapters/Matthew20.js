        Here is another illustration of the Kingdom of Heaven.
        <span class="jesus">
          "The owner of an estate went out early one morning to hire workers for
          his harvest field. <span className="sup">2</span>He agreed to pay them
          $20 a day and sent them out to work.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"A couple of hours later he was passing a
        hiring hall and saw some men standing around waiting for jobs,
        <span className="sup">4</span>so he sent them also into his fields,
        telling them he would pay them whatever was right at the end of the day.
        <span className="sup">5</span>At noon and again around three o'clock in
        the afternoon he did the same thing.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"At five o'clock that evening he was in
        town again and saw some more men standing around and asked them, 'Why
        haven't you been working today?'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"'Because no one hired us.' they replied.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "'Then go on out and join the others in my fields,' he told them.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"That evening he told the paymaster to
        call the men in and pay them, beginning with the last men first.
        <span className="sup">9</span>When the men hired at five o'clock were
        paid, each received $20. <span className="sup">10</span>So when the men
        hired earlier came to get theirs, they assumed they would receive much
        more. But they, too, were paid $20.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11,12</span>"They protested. 'Those fellows worked
        only one hour, and yet you've paid them just as much as those of us who
        worked all day in the scorching heat.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"'Friend,' he answered one of them, 'I
        did you no wrong! Didn't you agree to work all day for $20?
        <span className="sup">14</span>Take it and go. It is my desire to pay
        all the same; <span className="sup">15</span>is it against the law to
        give away my money if I want to? Should you be angry because I am kind?'
        <span className="sup">16</span>And so it is that the last shall be
        first, and the first, last."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>As Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem, he
        took the twelve disciples aside, <span className="sup">18</span>and
        talked to them about what would happen to him when they arrived.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "I will be betrayed to the chief priests and other Jewish leaders, and
        they will condemn me to die. <span className="sup">19</span>And they
        will hand me over to the Roman government, and I will be mocked and
        crucified, and the third day I will rise to life again."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then the mother of James and John, the
        sons of Zebedee, brought them to Jesus and respectfully asked a favor.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What is your request?" </span>he asked. She
        replied, "In your Kingdom, will you let my two sons sit on two thrones
        next to yours?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>But Jesus told her,
        <span class="jesus">"You don't know what you are asking!"</span> Then he
        turned to James and John and asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Are you able to drink from the terrible cup I am about to drink
          from?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Yes," they replied, "we are able!"</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"You shall indeed drink from it,"
        <span>he told them. </span>"But I have no right to say who will sit on
        the thrones next to mine. Those places are reserved for the persons my
        Father selects."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>The other ten disciples were indignant
        when they heard what James and John had asked for.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">25</span>But Jesus called them together and
          said,{' '}
        </span>
        "Among the heathen, kings are tyrants and each minor official lords it
        over those beneath him. <span className="sup">26</span>But among you it
        is quite different. Anyone wanting to be a leader among you must be your
        servant. <span className="sup">27</span>And if you want to be right at
        the top, you must serve like a slave. <span className="sup">28</span>
        Your attitude must be like my own, for I, the Messiah, did not come to
        be served, but to serve, and to give my life as a ransom for many."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>As Jesus and the disciples left the city
        of Jericho, a vast crowd surged along behind.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Two blind men were sitting beside the
        road and when they heard that Jesus was coming that way, they began
        shouting, "Sir, King David's Son, have mercy on us!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>The crowd told them to be quiet, but they
        only yelled the louder.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32,33</span>When Jesus came to the place where
        they were he stopped in the road and called,
        <span class="jesus">"What do you want me to do for you?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Sir," they said, "we want to see!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Jesus was moved with pity for them and
        touched their eyes. And instantly they could see, and followed him.
