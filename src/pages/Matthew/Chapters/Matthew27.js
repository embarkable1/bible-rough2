      <h3>Chapter 27</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When it was morning, the chief priests and Jewish leaders met again to
        discuss how to induce the Roman government to sentence Jesus to death.
        <span className="sup">2</span>Then they sent him in chains to Pilate,
        the Roman governor.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>About that time Judas, who betrayed him,
        when he saw that Jesus had been condemned to die, changed his mind and
        deeply regretted what he had done, and brought back the money to the
        chief priests and other Jewish leaders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"I have sinned," he declared, "for I have
        betrayed an innocent man."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"That's your problem," they retorted.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then he threw the money onto the floor of
        the Temple and went out and hanged himself.{' '}
        <span className="sup">6</span>The chief priests picked the money up. "We
        can't put it in the collection," they said, "since it's against our laws
        to accept money paid for murder."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>They talked it over and finally decided to
        buy a certain field where the clay was used by potters, and to make it
        into a cemetery for foreigners who died in Jerusalem.
        <span className="sup">8</span>That is why the cemetery is still called
        "The Field of Blood."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah
        which says,
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        "They took the thirty pieces of silver--the price at which he was valued
        by the people of Israel-- <span className="sup">10</span>and purchased a
        field from the potters as the Lord directed me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the
        Roman governor. "Are you the Jews' Messiah?" the governor asked him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Yes," <span>Jesus replied.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>But when the chief priests and other
        Jewish leaders made their many accusations against him, Jesus remained
        silent.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"Don't you hear what they are saying?"
        Pilate demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>But Jesus said nothing much to the
        governor's surprise.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Now the governor's custom was to release
        one Jewish prisoner each year during the Passover celebration--anyone
        they wanted. <span className="sup">16</span>This year there was a
        particularly notorious criminal in jail named Barabbas,
        <span className="sup">17</span>and as the crowds gathered before
        Pilate's house that morning he asked them, "Which shall I release to
        you--Barabbas, or Jesus your Messiah?" <span className="sup">18</span>
        For he knew very well that the Jewish leaders had arrested Jesus out of
        envy because of his popularity with the people.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Just then, as he was presiding over the
        court, Pilate's wife sent him this message: "Leave that good man alone;
        for I had a terrible nightmare concerning him last night."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Meanwhile the chief priests and Jewish
        officials persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas' release, and for
        Jesus' death. <span className="sup">21</span>So when the governor asked
        again, "Which of these two shall I release to you?" the crowd shouted
        back their reply: "Barabbas!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"Then what shall I do with Jesus, your
        Messiah?" Pilate asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">And they shouted, "Crucify him!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"Why?" Pilate demanded. "What has he done
        wrong?" But they kept shouting, "Crucify! Crucify!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>When Pilate saw that he wasn't getting
        anywhere, and that a riot was developing, he sent for a bowl of water
        and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the
        blood of this good man. The responsibility is yours!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>And the mob yelled back, "His blood be on
        us and on our children!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then Pilate released Barabbas to them.
        And after he had whipped Jesus, he gave him to the Roman soldiers to
        take away and crucify. <span className="sup">27</span>But first they
        took him into the armory and called out the entire contingent.
        <span className="sup">28</span>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe
        on him, <span className="sup">29</span>and made a crown from long thorns
        and put it on his head, and placed a stick in his right hand as a
        scepter and knelt before him in mockery. "Hail, King of the Jews," they
        yelled.
        <span className="sup">30</span>And they spat on him and grabbed the
        stick and beat him on the head with it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>After the mockery, they took off the robe
        and put his own garment on him again, and took him out to crucify him.
        <span className="sup">32</span>As they were on the way to the execution
        grounds they came across a man from Cyrene, in Africa--Simon was his
        name--and forced him to carry Jesus' cross.
        <span className="sup">33</span>Then they went out to an area known as
        Golgotha, that is, "Skull Hill," <span className="sup">34</span>where
        the soldiers gave him drugged wine to drink; but when he had tasted it,
        he refused.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>After the crucifixion, the soldiers threw
        dice to divide up his clothes among themselves.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then they sat around and watched him as
        he hung there. <span className="sup">37</span>And they put a sign above
        his head, "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Two robbers were also crucified there
        that morning, one on either side of him. <span className="sup">39</span>
        And the people passing by hurled abuse, shaking their heads at him and
        saying,
        <span className="sup">40</span>"So! You can destroy the Temple and build
        it again in three days, can you? Well, then, come on down from the cross
        if you are the Son of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41,42,43</span>And the chief priests and Jewish
        leaders also mocked him, "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't
        save himself! So you are the King of Israel, are you? Come down from the
        cross and we'll believe you! He trusted God--let God show his approval
        by delivering him! Didn't he say, 'I am God's Son'?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>And the robbers also threw the same in
        his teeth.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>That afternoon, the whole earth was
        covered with darkness for three hours, from noon until three o'clock.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>About three o'clock, Jesus shouted,
        <span class="jesus">"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani," </span>which means,
        "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>Some of the bystanders misunderstood and
        thought he was calling for Elijah. <span className="sup">48</span>One of
        them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine and put it on a stick and
        held it up to him to drink. <span className="sup">49</span>But the rest
        said, "Leave him alone. Let's see whether Elijah will come and save
        him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Then Jesus shouted out again, dismissed
        his spirit, and died. <span className="sup">51</span>And look! The
        curtain secluding the Holiest Places in the Temple was split apart from
        top to bottom; and the earth shook, and rocks broke,
        <span className="sup">52</span>and tombs opened, and many godly men and
        women who had died came back to life again.
        <span className="sup">53</span>After Jesus' resurrection, they left the
        cemetery and went into Jerusalem, and appeared to many people there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>The soldiers at the crucifixion and their
        sergeant were terribly frightened by the earthquake and all that
        happened. They exclaimed, "Surely this was God's Son."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>And many women who had come down from
        Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance.
        <span className="sup">56</span>Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary
        the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John (the
        sons of Zebedee).
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>When evening came, a rich man from
        Arimathea named Joseph, one of Jesus' followers,{' '}
        <span className="sup">58</span>went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
        And Pilate issued an order to release it to him.{' '}
        <span className="sup">59</span>Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a
        clean linen cloth, <span className="sup">60</span>and placed it in his
        own new rock-hewn tomb, and rolled a great stone across the entrance as
        he left. <span className="sup">61</span>Both Mary Magdalene and the
        other Mary were sitting nearby watching.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">62</span>The next day--at the close of the first
        day of the Passover ceremonies --the chief priests and Pharisees went to
        Pilate, <span className="sup">63</span>and told him, "Sir, that liar
        once said, 'After three days I will come back to life again.'
        <span className="sup">64</span>So we request an order from you sealing
        the tomb until the third day, to prevent his disciples from coming and
        stealing his body and then telling everyone he came back to life! If
        that happens we'll be worse off that we were at first."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>"Use your own Temple police," Pilate told
        them. "They can guard it safely enough."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">66</span>So they sealed the stone and posted
        guards to protect it from intrusion.
      </p>
