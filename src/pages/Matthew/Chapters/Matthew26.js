      <h3>Chapter 26</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When Jesus had finished his talk with his disciples, he told them,
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"As you know, the Passover celebration
        begins in two days, and I shall be betrayed and crucified."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>At that very moment the chief priests and
        other Jewish officials were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas the
        High Priest, <span className="sup">4</span>to discuss ways of capturing
        Jesus quickly, and killing him. <span className="sup">5</span>"But not
        during the Passover celebration," they agreed, "for there would be a
        riot."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Jesus now proceeded to Bethany, to the
        home of Simon the leper. <span className="sup">7</span>While he was
        eating, a woman came in with a bottle of very expensive perfume, and
        poured it over his head.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7,8</span>The disciples were indignant. "What a
        waste of good money," they said. "Why, she could have sold it for a
        fortune and given it to the poor."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Jesus knew what they were thinking, and
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why are you criticizing her? For she has done a good thing to me.
          <span className="sup">11</span>You will always have the poor among
          you, but you won't always have me. <span className="sup">12</span>She
          has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial.
          <span className="sup">13</span>And she will always be remembered for
          this deed. The story of what she has done will be told throughout the
          whole world, wherever the Good News is preached."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve
        apostles, went to the chief priests, <span className="sup">15</span>and
        asked, "How much will you pay me to get Jesus into your hands?" And they
        gave him thirty silver coins. <span className="sup">16</span>From that
        time on, Judas watched for an opportunity to betray Jesus to them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>On the first day of the Passover
        ceremonies, when bread made with yeast was purged from every Jewish
        home, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where shall we plan to eat
        the Passover?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Go into the city and see Mr. So-and-So, and tell him, 'Our Master
          says, my time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with my
          disciples at your house.'"{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">19</span>So the disciples did as he told them, and
        prepared the supper there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20,21</span>That evening as he sat eating with the
        Twelve, he said, <span class="jesus">"One of you will betray me."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Sorrow chilled their hearts, and each one
        asked, "Am I the one?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is the one I served first. <span className="sup">24</span>For I
          must die just as was prophesied, but woe to the man by whom I am
          betrayed. Far better for that one if he had never been born."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Judas, too, had asked him, "Rabbi, am I
        the one?" And Jesus had told him, <span class="jesus">"Yes."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>As they were eating, Jesus took a small
        loaf of bread and blessed it and broke it apart and gave it to the
        disciples and said,
        <span class="jesus">"Take it and eat it, for this is my body."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks
        for it and gave it to them and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Each one drink from it, <span className="sup">28</span>for this is my
          blood, sealing the New Covenant. It is poured out to forgive the sins
          of multitudes. <span className="sup">29</span>Mark my words--I will
          not drink this wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my
          Father's Kingdom."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>And when they had sung a hymn, they went
        out to the Mount of Olives.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Then Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Tonight you will all desert me. For it is written in the Scriptures
          <small>Zechariah 13:7</small> that God will smite the Shepherd, and
          the sheep of the flock will be scattered.
          <span className="sup">29</span>But after I have been brought back to
          life again I will go to Galilee, and meet you there."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Peter declared, "If everyone else deserts
        you, I won't."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The truth is that this very night, before the cock crows at dawn, you
          will deny me three times!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>"I would die first!" Peter insisted. And
        all the other disciples said the same thing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then Jesus brought them to a garden
        grove, Gethsemane, and told them to sit down and wait while he went on
        ahead to pray. <span className="sup">37</span>He took Peter with him and
        Zebedee's two sons James and John, and began to be filled with anguish
        and despair.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Then he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My soul is crushed with horror and sadness to the point of death . .
          . stay here . . . stay awake with me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>He went forward a little, and fell face
        downward on the ground, and prayed,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My Father! If it is possible, let this cup be taken away from me. But
          I want your will, not mine."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>Then he returned to the three disciples,
        and found them asleep.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Peter," <span>he called, </span>"couldn't you even stay awake with me
          one hour? <span className="sup">41</span>Keep alert and pray.
          Otherwise temptation will overpower you. For the spirit indeed is
          willing, but how weak the body is!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>Again he left them and prayed,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My Father! If this cup cannot go away until I drink it all, your will
          be done."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>He returned to them again and found them
        sleeping, for their eyes were heavy, <span className="sup">44</span>so
        he went back to prayer the third time, saying the same things again.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Then he came to the disciples and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Sleep on now and take your rest . . . but no! The time has come! I am
          betrayed into the hands of evil men! <span className="sup">46</span>
          Up! Let's be going! Look! Here comes the man who is betraying me!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>At that very moment while he was still
        speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived with a great crowd armed
        with swords and clubs, sent by the Jewish leaders.
        <span className="sup">48</span>Judas had told them to arrest the man he
        greeted, for that would be the one they were after.
        <span className="sup">49</span>So now Judas came straight to Jesus and
        said, "Hello, Master!" and embraced him in friendly fashion.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for."
        </span>
        Then the others grabbed him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>One of the men with Jesus pulled out a
        sword and slashed off the ear of the High Priest's servant.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>"Put away your sword,"
        <span>Jesus told him. </span>"Those using swords will get killed.
        <span className="sup">53</span>Don't you realized that could ask my
        Father for thousands of angels to protect us, and he would send them
        instantly?
        <span className="sup">54</span>But if I did, how would the Scriptures be
        fulfilled that describe what is happening now?"
        <span>
          <span className="sup">55</span>Then Jesus spoke to the crowd.
        </span>
        "Am I some dangerous criminal," <span>he asked, </span>"that you had to
        arm yourselves with swords and clubs before you could arrest me? I was
        with you teaching daily in the Temple and you didn't stop me then.
        <span className="sup">56</span>But this is all happening to fulfill the
        words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>Then the mob led him to the home of
        Caiaphas the High Priest, where all the Jewish leaders were gathering.
        <span className="sup">58</span>Meanwhile, Peter was following far to the
        rear, and came to the courtyard of the High Priest's house and went in
        and sat with the soldiers, and waited to see what was going to be done
        to Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>The chief priests and, in fact, the
        entire Jewish Supreme Court assembled there and looked for witnesses who
        would lie about Jesus, in order to build a case against him that would
        result in a death sentence. <span className="sup">60,61</span>But even
        though they found many who agreed to be false witnesses, these always
        contradicted each other.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Finally two men were found who declared, "This man said, 'I am able to
        destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">62</span>Then the High Priest stood up and said to
        Jesus, "Well, what about it? Did you say that, or didn't you?"
        <span className="sup">63</span>But Jesus remained silent.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then the High Priest said to him, "I demand in the name of the living
        God that you tell us whether you claim to be the Messiah, the Son of
        God."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">64</span>"Yes," <span>Jesus said, </span>"I am.
        And in the future you will see me, the Messiah, sitting at the right
        hand of God and returning on the clouds of heaven."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65,66</span>Then the High Priest tore at his own
        clothing, shouting, "Blasphemy! What need have we for other witnesses?
        You have all heard him say it! What is your verdict?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">They shouted, "Death!--Death!--Death!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">67</span>Then they spat in his face and struck him
        and some slapped him, <span className="sup">68</span>saying, "Prophesy
        to us, you Messiah! Who struck you that time?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">69</span>Meanwhile, as Peter was sitting in the
        courtyard a girl came over and said to him, "You were with Jesus, for
        both of you are from Galilee."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">70</span>But Peter denied it loudly. "I don't even
        know what you are talking about," he angrily declared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">71</span>Later, out by the gate, another girl
        noticed him and said to those standing around, "This man was with
        Jesus--form Nazareth."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">72</span>Again Peter denied it, this time with an
        oath. "I don't even know the man," he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">73</span>But after a while the men who had been
        standing there came over to him and said, "We know you are one of his
        disciples, for we can tell by your Galilean accent."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">74</span>Peter began to curse and swear. "I don't
        even know the man," he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And immediately the cock crowed. <span className="sup">75</span>Then
        Peter remembered what Jesus had said, "Before the cock crows, you will
        deny me three times." And he went away, crying bitterly.
