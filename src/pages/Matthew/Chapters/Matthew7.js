      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Don't criticize, and then you won't be criticized.
        <span className="sup">2</span>For others will treat you as you treat
        them.
        <span className="sup">3</span>And why worry about a speck in the eye of
        a brother when you have a board in your own?
        <span className="sup">4</span>Should you say, 'Friend, let me help you
        get that speck out of your eye,' when you can't even see because of the
        board in your own? <span className="sup">5</span>Hypocrite! First get
        rid of the board. Then you can see to help your brother.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"Don't give holy things to depraved men.
        Don't give pearls to swine! They will trample the pearls and turn and
        attack you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Ask, and you will be given what you ask
        for. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be opened.
        <span className="sup">8</span>For everyone who asks, receives. Anyone
        who seeks, finds. If only you will knock, the door will open.
        <span className="sup">9</span>If a child asks his father for a loaf of
        bread, will he be given a stone instead? <span className="sup">10</span>
        If he asks for a fish, will he be given a poisonous snake? Of course
        not!
        <span className="sup">11</span>And if you hard-hearted, sinful men know
        how to give good gifts to your children, won't your Father in heaven
        even more certainly give good gifts to those who ask him for them?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Do for others what you want them to do
        for you. This is the teaching of the laws of Moses in a nutshell.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"Heaven can be entered only through the
        narrow gate! The highway to hell is broad, and its gate is wide enough
        for all the multitudes who choose its easy way.
        <span className="sup">14</span>But the Gateway to Life is small, and the
        road is narrow, and only a few ever find it.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"Beware of false teachers who come
        disguised as harmless sheep, but are wolves and will tear you apart.
        <span className="sup">16</span>You can detect them by the way they act,
        just as you can identify a tree by its fruit. You need never confuse
        grapevines with thorn bushes or figs with thistles.
        <span className="sup">17</span>Different kinds of fruit trees can
        quickly be identified by examining their fruit.{' '}
        <span className="sup">18</span>A variety that produces delicious fruit
        never produces an inedible kind. And a tree producing an inedible kind
        can't produce what is good.
        <span className="sup">19</span>So the trees having the inedible fruit
        are chopped down and thrown on the fire. <span className="sup">20</span>
        Yes, the way to identify a tree or a person is by the kind of fruit
        produced.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Not all who sound religious are really
        godly people. They may refer to me as 'Lord,' but still won't get to
        heaven. For the decisive question is whether they obey my Father in
        heaven.
        <span className="sup">22</span>At the Judgment many will tell me, 'Lord,
        Lord, we told others about you and used your name to cast out demons and
        to do many other great miracles.' <span className="sup">23</span>But I
        will reply, 'You have never been mine. Go away, for your deeds are
        evil.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"All who listen to my instructions and
        follow them are wise, like a man who builds his house on solid rock.
        <span className="sup">25</span>Though the rain comes in torrents, and
        the floods rise and the storm winds beat against his house, it won't
        collapse, for it is built on rock.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But those who hear my instructions and
        ignore them are foolish, like a man who builds his house on sand.
        <span className="sup">27</span>For when the rains and floods come, and
        storm winds beat against his house, it will fall with a mighty crash."
        <span>
          <span className="sup">28</span>The crowds were amazed at Jesus'
          sermons,
          <span className="sup">29</span>for he taught as one who had great
          authority, and not as their Jewish leaders.
