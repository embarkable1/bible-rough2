      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Some Pharisees and other Jewish leaders now arrived from Jerusalem to
        interview Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Why do your disciples disobey the ancient
        Jewish traditions?" they demanded. "For they ignore our ritual of
        ceremonial handwashing before they eat." <span className="sup">3</span>
        He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "And why do your traditions violate the direct commandments of God?
          <span className="sup">4</span>For instance, God's law is 'Honor your
          father and mother; anyone who reviles his parents must die.'
          <span className="sup">5,6</span>But you say, 'Even if your parents are
          in need, you may give their support money to the church instead.' And
          so, by your man-made rule, you nullify the direct command of God to
          honor and care for your parents. <span className="sup">7</span>You
          hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you,{' '}
          <span className="sup">8</span>'These people say they honor me, but
          their hearts are far away.
          <span className="sup">9</span>Their worship is worthless, for they
          teach their man-made laws instead of those from God.'"
        </span>
        <small>Isaiah 29:13</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then Jesus called to the crowds and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Listen to what I say and try to understand.
          <span className="sup">11</span>You aren't made unholy by eating
          non-kosher food! It is what you <em>say</em> and <em>think</em> that
          makes you unclean."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Then the disciples came and told him,
        "You offended the Pharisees by that remark."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13,14</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Every plant not planted by my Father shall be rooted up, so ignore
          them. They are blind guides leading the blind, and both will fall into
          a ditch."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then Peter asked Jesus to explain what he
        meant when he said that people are not defiled by non-kosher food.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't you understand?" <span>Jesus asked him.</span>
          <span className="sup">17</span>"Don't you see that anything you eat
          passes through the digestive tract and out again?
          <span className="sup">18</span>But evil words come from an evil heart,
          and defile the man who says them. <span className="sup">19</span>For
          from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornication,
          theft, lying and slander. <span className="sup">20</span>These are
          what defile; but there is no spiritual defilement from eating without
          first going through the ritual of ceremonial handwashing!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Jesus then left that part of the country
        and walked the fifty miles to Tyre and Sidon.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>A woman from Canaan who was living there
        came to him, pleading, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, King David's Son! For
        my daughter has a demon within her, and it torments her constantly."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>But Jesus gave her no reply--not even a
        word. Then his disciples urged him to send her away. "Tell her to get
        going," they said, "for she is bothering us with all her begging."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Then he said to the woman,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I was sent to help the Jews--the lost sheep of Israel--not the
          Gentiles."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>But she came and worshiped him and pled
        again, "Sir, help me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "It doesn't seem right to take bread from the children and throw it to
          the dogs,"
        </span>
        he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Yes, it is!" she replied, "for even the
        puppies beneath the table are permitted to eat the crumbs that fall."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Woman," <span>Jesus told her, </span>"your faith is large, and your
          request is granted."
        </span>
        And her daughter was healed right then.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus now returned to the Sea of Galilee,
        and climbed a hill and sat there. <span className="sup">30</span>And a
        vast crowd brought him their lame, blind, maimed, and those who couldn't
        speak, and many others, and laid them before Jesus, and he healed them
        all. <span className="sup">31</span>What a spectacle it was! Those who
        hadn't been able to say a word before were talking excitedly, and those
        with missing arms and legs had new ones; the crippled were walking and
        jumping around, and those who had been blind were gazing about them! The
        crowds just marveled, and praised the God of Israel.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Then Jesus called his disciples to him
        and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I pity these people--they've been here with me for three days now,
          and have nothing left to eat; I don't want to send them away hungry or
          they will faint along the road."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>The disciples replied, "And where would
        we get enough here in the desert for all this mob to eat?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Jesus asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"How much food do you have?"</span> And they
        replied, "Seven loaves of bread and a few small fish!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Then Jesus told all of the people to sit
        down on the ground, <span className="sup">36</span>and he took the seven
        loaves and the fish, and gave thanks to God for them, and divided them
        into pieces, and gave them to the disciples who presented them to the
        crowd.
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>And everyone ate until full--4,000 men
        besides the women and children! And afterwards, when the scraps were
        picked up, there were seven basketfuls left over!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Then Jesus sent the people home and got
        into the boat and crossed to Magadan.
