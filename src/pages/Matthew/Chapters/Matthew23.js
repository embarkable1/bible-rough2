      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus said to the crowds, and to his disciples,
        <span className="sup">2</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "You would think these Jewish leaders and these Pharisees were Moses,
          the way they keep making up so many laws!
          <span className="sup">3</span>And of course you should obey their
          every whim! It may be all right to do what they say, but above
          anything else, <em>don't follow their example.</em> For they don't do
          what they tell you to do. <span className="sup">4</span>They load you
          with impossible demands that they themselves don't even try to keep.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Everything they do is done for show. They
        act holy by wearing on their arms little prayer boxes with Scripture
        verses inside, and by lengthening the memorial fringes of their robes.
        <span className="sup">6</span>And how they love to sit at the head table
        at banquets, and in the reserved pews in the synagogue!
        <span className="sup">7</span>How they enjoy the deference paid them on
        the streets, and to be called 'Rabbi' and 'Master'!
        <span className="sup">8</span>Don't ever let anyone call you that. For
        only God is your Rabbi and all of you are on the same level, as
        brothers.
        <span className="sup">9</span>And don't address anyone here on earth as
        'Father,' for only God in heaven should be addressed like that.
        <span className="sup">10</span>And don't be called 'Master,' for only
        one is your master, even the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"The more lowly your service to others,
        the greater you are. To be the greatest, be a servant.
        <span className="sup">12</span>But those who think themselves great
        shall be disappointed and humbled; and those who humble themselves shall
        be exalted.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13,14</span>"Woe to you. Pharisees, and you other
        religious leaders. Hypocrites! For you won't let others enter the
        Kingdom of Heaven, and won't go in yourselves. And you pretend to be
        holy, with all your long, public prayers in the streets, while you are
        evicting widows from their homes. Hypocrites!
        <span className="sup">15</span>Yes, woe upon you hypocrites. For you go
        to all lengths to make one convert, and then turn him into twice the son
        of hell you are yourselves. <span className="sup">16</span>Blind guides!
        Woe upon you! For your rule is that to swear 'By God's Temple' means
        nothing--you can break that oath, but to swear 'By the gold in the
        Temple' is binding! <span className="sup">17</span>Blind fools! Which is
        greater, the gold, or the Temple that sanctifies the gold?
        <span className="sup">18</span>And you say that to take an oath 'By the
        altar' can be broken, but to swear 'By the gifts on the altar' is
        binding! <span className="sup">19</span>Blind! For which is greater, the
        gift on the altar, or the altar itself that sanctifies the gift?
        <span className="sup">20</span>When you swear 'By the altar' you are
        swearing by it and everything on it, <span className="sup">21</span>and
        when you swear 'By the Temple' you are swearing by it, and by God who
        lives in it. <span className="sup">22</span>And when you swear 'By
        heavens' you are swearing by the Throne of God and by God himself.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"Yes, woe upon you, Pharisees, and you
        other religious leaders--hypocrites! For you tithe down to the last mint
        leaf in your garden, but ignore the important things--justice and mercy
        and faith. Yes, you should tithe, but you shouldn't leave the more
        important things undone. <span className="sup">24</span>Blind guides!
        You strain out a gnat and swallow a camel.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Woe to you, Pharisees, and you religious
        leaders--hypocrites! You are so careful to polish the outside of the
        cup, but the inside is foul with extortion and greed.
        <span className="sup">26</span>Blind Pharisees! First cleanse the inside
        of the cup, and then the whole cup will be clean.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Woe to you, Pharisees, and you religious
        leaders! You are like beautiful mausoleums--full of dead men's bones,
        and of foulness and corruption. <span className="sup">28</span>You try
        to look like saintly men, but underneath those pious robes of yours are
        hearts besmirched with every sort of hypocrisy and sin.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30</span>"Yes, woe to you, Pharisees, and you
        religious leaders--hypocrites! For you build monuments to the prophets
        killed by your fathers and lay flowers on the graves of the godly men
        they destroyed, and say, 'We certainly would never have acted as our
        fathers did.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"In saying that, you are accusing
        yourselves of being the sons of wicked men.{' '}
        <span className="sup">32</span>And you are following in their steps,
        filling up the full measure of their evil.
        <span className="sup">33</span>Snakes! Sons of vipers! How shall you
        escape the judgment of hell?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"I will send you prophets, and wise men,
        and inspired writers, and you will kill some by crucifixion, and rip
        open the backs of others with whips in your synagogues, and hound them
        from city to city, <span className="sup">35</span>so that you will
        become guilty of all the blood of murdered godly men from righteous Abel
        to Zechariah (son of Barachiah), slain by you in the Temple between the
        altar and the sanctuary. <span className="sup">36</span>Yes, all the
        accumulated judgment of the centuries shall break upon the heads of this
        very generation.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that
        kills the prophets, and stones all those God sends to her! How often I
        have wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks
        beneath her wings, but you wouldn't let me.
        <span className="sup">38</span>And now your house is left to you,
        desolate.
        <span className="sup">39</span>For I tell you this, you will never see
        me again until you are ready to welcome the one sent to you from God.
