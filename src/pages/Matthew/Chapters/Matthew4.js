      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus was led out into the wilderness by the Holy Spirit, to be
        tempted there by Satan. <span className="sup">2</span>For forty days and
        forty nights he ate nothing and became very hungry.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Then Satan tempted him to get food by
        changing stones into loaves of bread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"It will prove you are the Son of God," he said.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>But Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "No! For the Scriptures tell us that bread won't feed men's souls:
          obedience to every word of God is what we need."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then Satan took him to Jerusalem to the
        roof of the Temple. <span className="sup">6</span>"Jump off," he said,
        "and prove you are the Son of God; for the Scriptures declare, 'God will
        send his angels to keep you from harm,' . . . they will prevent you from
        smashing on the rocks below."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Jesus retorted,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It also says not to put the Lord your God to a foolish test!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Next Satan took him to the peak of a very
        high mountain and showed him the nations of the world and all their
        glory.
        <span className="sup">9</span>"I'll give it all to you," he said, "if
        you will only kneel and worship me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Get out of here, Satan," <span>Jesus told him. </span>"The Scriptures
          say, 'Worship only the Lord God. Obey only him.'"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Then Satan went away, and angels came and
        cared for Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>When Jesus heard that John had been
        arrested, he left Judea and returned home to Nazareth in Galilee; but
        soon he moved to Capernaum, beside the Lake of Galilee, close to Zebulun
        and Naphtali. <span className="sup">14</span>This fulfilled Isaiah's
        prophecy:
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        <span className="sup">15,16</span>"The land of Zebulun and the land of
        Naphtali, beside the Lake, and the countryside beyond the Jordan River,
        and Upper Galilee where so many foreigners live--there the people who
        sat in darkness have seen a great Light; they sat in the land of death,
        and the Light broke through upon them." <small>Isaiah 9:1,2</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>From then on, Jesus began to preach,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Turn from sin, and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven in near."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>One day as he was walking along the beach
        beside the Lake of Galilee, he saw two brothers--Simon, also called
        Peter, and Andrew--out in a boat fishing with a net, for they were
        commercial fishermen.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus called out,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Come along with me and I will show you how to fish for the souls of
          men!"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">20</span>And they left their nets at once and went
        with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>A little farther up the beach he saw two
        other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father
        Zebedee, mending their nets; and he called to them to come too.
        <span className="sup">22</span>At once they stopped their work and,
        leaving their father behind, went with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus traveled all through Galilee
        teaching in the Jewish synagogues, everywhere preaching the Good News
        about the Kingdom of Heaven. And he healed every kind of sickness and
        disease.
        <span className="sup">24</span>The report of his miracles spread far
        beyond the borders of Galilee so that sick folk were soon coming to be
        healed from as far away as Syria. And whatever their illness and pain,
        or if they were possessed by demons, or were insane, or paralyzed--he
        healed them all. <span className="sup">25</span>Enormous crowds followed
        him wherever he went--people from Galilee, and the Ten Cities, and
        Jerusalem, and from all over Judea, and even from across the Jordan
        River.
