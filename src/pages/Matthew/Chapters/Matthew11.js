      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve
        disciples, he went off preaching in the cities where they were scheduled
        to go.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>John the Baptist, who was now in prison,
        heard all about all the miracles the Messiah was doing, so he sent his
        disciples to ask Jesus, <span className="sup">3</span>"Are you really
        the one we are waiting for, or shall we keep on looking?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span> <span>Jesus told them, </span>"Go back to
        John and tell him about the miracles you've seen me do--
        <span className="sup">5</span>the blind people I've healed, and the lame
        people now walking without help, and the cured lepers, and the deaf who
        hear, and the dead raised to life; and tell him about my preaching the
        Good News to the poor. <span className="sup">6</span>Then give him this
        message, 'Blessed are those who don't doubt me.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>When John's disciples had gone, Jesus
        began talking about him to the crowds.
        <span class="jesus">
          "When you went out into the barren wilderness to see John, what did
          you expect him to be like? Grass blowing in the wind?
          <span className="sup">8</span>Or were you expecting to see a man
          dressed as a prince in a palace? <span className="sup">9</span>Or a
          prophet of God? Yes, and he is more than just a prophet.
          <span className="sup">10</span>For John is the man mentioned in the
          Scriptures--a messenger to precede me, to announce my coming, and
          prepare people to receive me.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"Truly, of all men ever born, none shines
        more brightly than John the Baptist. And yet, even the lesser lights in
        the Kingdom of Heaven will be greater than he is!
        <span className="sup">12</span>And from the time John the Baptist began
        preaching and baptizing until now, ardent multitudes have been crowding
        toward the Kingdom of Heaven, <span className="sup">13</span>for all the
        laws and prophets looked forward [to the Messiah]. Then John appeared,
        <span className="sup">14</span>and if you are willing to understand what
        I mean, he is Elijah, the one the prophets said would come [at the time
        the Kingdom begins]. <span className="sup">15</span>If ever you were
        willing to listen, listen now!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"What shall I say about this nation?
        These people are like children playing, who say to their little friends,
        <span className="sup">17</span>'We played wedding and you weren't happy,
        so we played funeral but you weren't sad.'{' '}
        <span className="sup">18</span>For John the Baptist doesn't even drink
        wine and often goes without food, and you say, 'He's crazy.'{' '}
        <span className="sup">19</span>And I, the Messiah, feast and drink, and
        you complain that I am 'a glutton and a drinking man, and hang around
        with the worst sort of sinners!' But brilliant men like you can justify
        your every inconsistency!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then he began to pour out his
        denunciations against the cities where he had done most of his miracles,
        because they hadn't turned to God.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Woe to you, Chorazin, and woe to you,
        Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in your streets had been done in
        wicked Tyre and Sidon their people would have repented long ago in shame
        and humility. <span className="sup">22</span>Truly, Tyre and Sidon will
        be better off on the Judgment Day than you!{' '}
        <span className="sup">23</span>And Capernaum, though highly honored,
        shall go down to hell! For if the marvelous miracles I did in you had
        been done in Sodom, it would still be here today.{' '}
        <span className="sup">24</span>Truly, Sodom will be better off at the
        Judgment Day than you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>And Jesus prayed this prayer:
        <span class="jesus">
          "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding the truth
          from those who think themselves so wise, and for revealing it to
          little children. <span className="sup">26</span>Yes Father, for it
          pleased you to do it this way! . . .
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Everything has been entrusted to me by
        my Father. Only the Father knows the Son, and the Father is known only
        by the Son and by those to whom the Son reveals him.
        <span className="sup">28</span>Come to me and I will give you rest--all
        of you who work so hard beneath a heavy yoke.
        <span className="sup">29, 30</span>Wear my yoke--for it fits
        perfectly--and let me teach you; for I am gentle and humble, and you
        shall find rest for your souls; for I give you only light burdens."
      </p>
