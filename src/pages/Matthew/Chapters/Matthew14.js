      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When King Herod heard about Jesus, <span className="sup">2</span>he said
        to his men, "This must be John the Baptist, come back to life again.
        That is why he can do these miracles." <span className="sup">3</span>For
        Herod had arrested John and chained him in prison at the demand of his
        wife Herodias, his brother Philip's ex-wife,
        <span className="sup">4</span>because John had told him it was wrong for
        him to marry her. <span className="sup">5</span>He would have killed
        John but was afraid of a riot, for all the people believed John was a
        prophet.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>But at a birthday party for Herod,
        Herodias' daughter performed a dance that greatly pleased him,
        <span className="sup">7</span>so he vowed to give her anything she
        wanted.
        <span className="sup">8</span>Consequently, at her mother's urging, the
        girl asked for John the Baptist's head on a tray.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>The king was grieved, but because of his
        oath, and because he didn't want to back down in front of his guests, he
        issued the necessary orders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>So John was beheaded in the prison,
        <span className="sup">11</span>and his head was brought on a tray and
        given to the girl, who took it to her mother.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Then John's disciples came for his body
        and buried it, and came to tell Jesus what had happened.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>As soon as Jesus heard the news, he went
        off by himself in a boat to a remote area to be alone. But the crowds
        saw where he was headed, and followed by land from many villages.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>So when Jesus came out of the wilderness,
        a vast crowd was waiting for him and he pitied them and healed their
        sick.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>That evening the disciples came to him
        and said, "It is already past time for supper, and there is nothing to
        eat here in the desert; send the crowds away so they can go to the
        villages and buy some food."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">"That isn't necessary--you feed them!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"What!" they exclaimed. "We have exactly
        five small loaves of bread and two fish!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Bring them here,"</span> he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Then he told the people to sit down on
        the grass; and he took the five loaves and two fish, looked up into the
        sky and asked God's blessing on the meal, then broke the loaves apart
        and gave them to the disciples to place before the people.
        <span className="sup">20</span>And everyone ate until full! And when the
        scraps were picked up afterwards, there were twelve basketfuls left
        over! <span className="sup">21</span>(About 5,000 men were in the crowd
        that day, besides all the women and children.)
        <span className="sup">22</span>Immediately after this, Jesus told his
        disciples to get into their boat and cross to the other side of the lake
        while he stayed to get the people started home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23,24</span>Then afterwards he went up into the
        hills to pray. Night fell, and out on the lake the disciples were in
        trouble. For the wind had risen and they were fighting heavy seas.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>About four o'clock in the morning Jesus
        came to them, walking on the water! <span className="sup">26</span>They
        screamed in terror, for they thought he was a ghost.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>But Jesus immediately spoke to them,
        reassuring them. <span class="jesus">"Don't be afraid!"</span> he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Then Peter called to him: "Sir, if it is
        really you, tell me to come over to you, walking on the water."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"All right,"
        <span>the Lord said, </span>"come along!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward
        Jesus. <span className="sup">30</span>But when he looked around at the
        high waves, he was terrified and began to sink. "Save me, Lord!" he
        shouted.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Instantly Jesus reached out his hand and
        rescued him.
        <span class="jesus">
          "O man of little faith," <span>Jesus said.</span> "Why did you doubt
          me?"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">32</span>And when they had climbed back into the
        boat, the wind stopped.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>The others sat there, awestruck. "You
        really are the Son of God!" they exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>They landed at Gennesaret.
        <span className="sup">35</span>The news of their arrival spread quickly
        throughout the city, and soon people were rushing around, telling
        everyone to bring in their sick to be healed.
        <span className="sup">36</span>The sick begged him to let them touch
        even the tassel of his robe, and all who did were healed.
