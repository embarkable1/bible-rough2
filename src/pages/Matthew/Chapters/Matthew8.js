        Large crowds followed Jesus as he came down the hillside.

          Look! A leper is approaching. He kneels before him, worshiping. "Sir,"
          the leper pleads, "if you want to, you can heal me."

          Jesus touches the man. <span class="jesus">"I want to,"</span> he
          says; <span class="jesus">"be healed."</span> And instantly the
          leprosy disappears.

        <em>
          Then Jesus says to him,
          <span class="jesus">
            "Don't stop to talk to anyone; go right over to the priest to be
            examined; and take with you the offering required by Moses' law for
            lepers who are healed--a public testimony of your cure."

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>When Jesus arrived in Capernaum, a Roman
        army captain came and pled with him to come to his home and heal his
        servant boy who was in bed paralyzed and racked with pain.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes," <span>Jesus said, </span>"I will come and heal him."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>Then the officer said, "Sir, I am not
        worthy to have you in my home; [and it isn't necessary for you to come].
        If you will only stand here and say, 'Be healed,' my servant will get
        well! I know, because I am under the authority of my superior officers
        and I have authority over my soldiers, and I say to one, 'Go,' and he
        goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my slave boy, 'Do
        this or that,' and he does it. And I know you have authority to tell his
        sickness to go--and it will go!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Jesus stood there amazed! Turning to the
        crowd he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I haven't seen faith like this in all the land of Israel!
          <span className="sup">11</span>And I tell you this, that many Gentiles
          [like this Roman officer], shall come from all over the world and sit
          down in the Kingdom of Heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
          <span className="sup">12</span>And many an Israelite--those for whom
          the Kingdom was prepared--shall be cast into outer darkness, into the
          place of weeping and torment."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then Jesus said to the Roman officer,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Go on home. What you have believed has happened!"
        </span>
        And the boy was healed that same hour!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>When Jesus arrived at Peter's house,
        Peter's mother-in-law was in bed with a high fever.
        <span className="sup">15</span>But when Jesus touched her hand, the
        fever left her; and she got up and prepared a meal for them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>That evening several demon-possessed
        people were brought to Jesus; and when he spoke a single word, all the
        demons fled; and all the sick were healed.{' '}
        <span className="sup">17</span>This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah,
        "He took our sicknesses and bore our diseases."{' '}
        <small>Isaiah 53:4</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>When Jesus noticed how large the crowd
        was growing, he instructed his disciples to get ready to cross to the
        other side of the lake.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Just then one of the Jewish religious
        teachers said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you no matter where you
        go!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but I, the Messiah, have no
          home of my own--no place to lay my head."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Another of his disciples said, "Sir, when
        my father is dead, then I will follow you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>But Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Follow me <em>now!</em> Let those who are spiritually dead care for
          their own dead."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>The he got into a boat and started across
        the lake with his disciples. <span className="sup">24</span>Suddenly a
        terrible storm came up, with waves higher than the boat. But Jesus was
        asleep.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>The disciples went to him and wakened
        him, shouting, "Lord, save us! We're sinking!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>But Jesus answered,
        <span class="jesus">
          "O you men of little faith! Why are you so frightened?"
        </span>
        Then he stood up and rebuked the wind and waves, and the storm subsided
        and all was calm. <span className="sup">27</span>The disciples just sat
        there, awed! "Who is this," they asked themselves, "that even the winds
        and the sea obey him?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>When they arrived on the other side of
        the lake, in the country of the Gadarenes, two men with demons in them
        met him. They lived in a cemetery and were so dangerous that no one
        could go through that area.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>They began screaming at him, "What do you
        want with us, O Son of God? You have no right to torment us yet."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>A herd of pigs was feeding in the
        distance,
        <span className="sup">31</span>so the demons begged, "If you cast us
        out, send us into that herd of pigs."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "All right," <span>Jesus told them.</span> "Begone."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And they came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the whole herd
        rushed over a cliff and drowned in the water below.
        <span className="sup">33</span>The herdsmen fled to the nearest city
        with the story of what had happened, <span className="sup">34</span>and
        the entire population came rushing out to see Jesus, and begged him to
        go away and leave them alone.
