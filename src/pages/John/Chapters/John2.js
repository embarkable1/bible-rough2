      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Two days later Jesus' mother was a guest at a wedding in the village of
        Cana in Galilee, <span className="sup">2</span>and Jesus and his
        disciples were invited too. <span className="sup">3</span>The wine
        supply ran out during the festivities, and Jesus' mother came to him
        with the problem.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">
          "I can't help you now," <span>he said. </span>"It isn't yet my time
          for miracles."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>But his mother told the servants, "Do
        whatever he tells you to."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Six stone waterpots were standing there;
        they were used for Jewish ceremonial purposes and held perhaps twenty to
        thirty gallons each. <span className="sup">7,8</span>Then Jesus told the
        servants to fill them to the brim with water. When this was done he
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Dip some out and take it to the master of ceremonies."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>When the master of ceremonies tasted the
        water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of
        course, the servants did), he called the bridegroom over.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"This is wonderful stuff!" he said.
        "You're different from most. Usually a host uses the best wine first,
        and afterwards, when everyone is full and doesn't care, then he brings
        out the less expensive brands. But you have kept the best for the last!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>This miracle at Cana in Galilee was
        Jesus' first public demonstration of his heaven-sent power. And his
        disciples believed that he really was the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>After the wedding he left for Capernaum
        for a few days with his mother, brothers, and disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then it was time for the annual Jewish
        Passover celebration, and Jesus went to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>In the Temple area he saw merchants
        selling cattle, sheep, and doves for sacrifices, and money changers
        behind their counters. <span className="sup">15</span>Jesus made a whip
        from some ropes and chased them all out, and drove out the sheep and
        oxen, scattering the money changers' coins over the floor and turning
        over their tables!
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then, going over to the men selling
        doves, he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Get these things out of here. Don't turn my Father's House into a
          market!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Then his disciples remembered this
        prophecy from the Scriptures: "Concern for God's House will be my
        undoing."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"What right have you to order them out?"
        the Jewish leaders demanded. "If you have this authority from God, show
        us a miracle to prove it."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "All right," <span>Jesus replied, </span>"this is the miracle I will
          do for you: Destroy this sanctuary and in three days I will raise it
          up!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"What!" they exclaimed. "It took
        forty-six years to build this Temple, and you can do it in three days?"
        <span className="sup">21</span>But by "this sanctuary" he meant his
        body.
        <span className="sup">22</span>After he came back to life again, the
        disciples remembered his saying this and realized that what he had
        quoted from the Scriptures really did refer to him, and had all come
        true!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Because of the miracles he did in
        Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many people were convinced that
        he was indeed the Messiah. <span className="sup">24,25</span>But Jesus
        didn't trust them, for he knew mankind to the core. No one needed to
        tell him how changeable human nature is!
