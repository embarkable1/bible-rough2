      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Let not your heart be troubled. You are trusting God, now trust in me.
        <span className="sup">2,3</span>There are many homes up there where my
        Father lives, and I am coming to prepare them for your coming. When
        everything is ready, then I will come and get you, so that you can
        always be with me where I am. If this weren't so, I would tell you
        plainly. <span className="sup">4</span>And you know where I am going and
        how to get there."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"No, we don't," Thomas said. "We haven't
        any idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am the Way--yes, and the Truth and the Life. No one can get to the
          Father except by means of me. <span className="sup">7</span>If you had
          known who I am, then you would have known who my Father is. From now
          on you know him--and have seen him!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Philip said, "Sir, show us the Father and
        we will be satisfied."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't you even yet know who I am, Philip, even after all this time I
          have been with you? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why
          are you asking to see him? <span className="sup">10</span>Don't you
          believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I
          say are not my own but are from my Father who lives in me. And he does
          his work through me. <span className="sup">11</span>Just believe
          it--that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or else believe
          it because of the mighty miracles you have seen me do.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>"In solemn truth I tell you, anyone
        believing in me shall do the same miracles I have done, and even greater
        ones, because I am going to be with the Father. You can ask him for
        <em>anything</em>, using my name, and I will do it, for this will bring
        praise to the Father because of what I, the Son, will do for you.
        <span className="sup">14</span>Yes, ask <em>anything</em>, using my
        name, and I will do it!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15,16</span>"If you love me, obey me; and I will
        ask the Father and he will give you another Comforter, and he will never
        leave you. <span className="sup">17</span>He is the Holy Spirit, the
        Spirit who leads into all truth. The world at large cannot receive him,
        for it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognize him. But you do, for
        he lives with you now and some day shall be in you.
        <span className="sup">18</span>No, I will not abandon you or leave you
        as orphans in the storm--I will come to you.{' '}
        <span className="sup">19</span>In just a little while I will be gone
        from the world, but I will still be present with you. For I will live
        again--and you will too.
        <span className="sup">20</span>When I come back to life again, you will
        know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.
        <span className="sup">21</span>The one who obeys me is the one who loves
        me; and because he loves me, my Father will love him; and I will too,
        and I will reveal myself to him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but his other
        disciple with that name) said to him, "Sir, why are going to reveal
        yourself only to us disciples and not to the world at large?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Because I will only reveal myself to those who love me and obey me.
          The Father will love them too, and we will come to them and live with
          them. <span className="sup">24</span>Anyone who doesn't obey me
          doesn't love me. And remember, I am not making up this answer to your
          question! It is the answer given by the Father who sent me.
          <span className="sup">25</span>I am telling you these things now while
          I am still with you. <span className="sup">26</span>But when the
          Father sends the Comforter instead of me-- and by the Comforter I mean
          the Holy Spirit--he will teach you much, as well as remind you of
          everything I myself have told you.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"I am leaving you with a gift--peace of
        mind and heart! And the peace I give isn't fragile like the peace the
        world gives. So don't be troubled or afraid.
        <span className="sup">28</span>Remember what I told you--I am going
        away, but I will come back to you again. If you really love me, you will
        be very happy for me, for now I can go to the Father, who is greater
        than I am. <span className="sup">29</span>I have told you these things
        before they happen so that when they do, you will believe [in me].
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"I don't have much more time to talk to
        you, for the evil prince of this world approaches. He has no power over
        me,
        <span className="sup">31</span>but I will freely do what the Father
        requires of me so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come,
        let's be going.
