      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Anyone refusing to walk through the gate into a sheepfold, who sneaks
        over the wall, must surely be a thief! <span className="sup">2</span>For
        a shepherd comes through the gate. <span className="sup">3</span>The
        gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his voice and come
        to him; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
        <span className="sup">4</span>He walks ahead of them; and they follow
        him, for they recognize his voice. <span className="sup">5</span>They
        won't follow a stranger but will run from him, for they don't recognize
        his voice."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Those who heard Jesus use this
        illustration didn't understand what he meant,{' '}
        <span className="sup">7</span>so he explained it to them.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "I am the Gate for the sheep,"
        <span>
          he said. <span className="sup">8</span>{' '}
        </span>
        "All others who came before me were thieves and robbers. But the true
        sheep did not listen to them. <span className="sup">9</span>Yes, I am
        the Gate. Those who come in by way of the Gate will be saved and will go
        in and out and find green pastures. <span className="sup">10</span>The
        thief's purpose is to steal, kill and destroy. My purpose is to give
        life in all its fullness.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"I am the Good Shepherd. The Good
        Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.{' '}
        <span className="sup">12</span>A hired man will run when he sees a wolf
        coming and will leave the sheep, for they aren't his and he isn't their
        shepherd. And so the wolf leaps on them and scatters the flock.{' '}
        <span className="sup">13</span>The hired man runs because he is hired
        and has no real concern for the sheep.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"I am the Good Shepherd and know my own
        sheep, and they know me, <span className="sup">15</span>just as my
        Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the
        sheep.
        <span className="sup">16</span>I have other sheep, too, in another fold.
        I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice; and there will be
        one flock with one Shepherd.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"The Father loves me because I lay down
        my life that I may have it back again. <span className="sup">18</span>No
        one can kill me without my consent--I lay down my life voluntarily. For
        I have the right and power to lay it down when I want to and also the
        right and power to take it again. For the Father has given me this
        right."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>When he said these things, the Jewish
        leaders were again divided in their opinions about him.
        <span className="sup">20</span>Some of them said, "He has a demon or
        else is crazy. Why listen to a man like that?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Others said, "This doesn't sound to us
        like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of blind
        men?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>It was winter, and Jesus was in
        Jerusalem at the time of the Dedication Celebration. He was at the
        Temple, walking through the section known as Solomon's Hall.
        <span className="sup">24</span>The Jewish leaders surrounded him and
        asked, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the
        Messiah, tell us plainly."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"I have already told you, and you don't
        believe me," <span>Jesus replied. </span>"The proof is in the miracles I
        do in the name of my Father. <span className="sup">26</span>But you
        don't believe me because you are not part of my flock.
        <span className="sup">27</span>My sheep recognize my voice, and I know
        them, and they follow me. <span className="sup">28</span>I give them
        eternal life and they shall never perish. No one shall snatch them away
        from me,
        <span className="sup">29</span>for my Father has given them to me, and
        he is more powerful than anyone else, so no one can kidnap them from me.
        <span className="sup">30</span>I and the Father are one."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Then again the Jewish leaders picked up
        stones to kill him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "At God's direction I have done many a miracle to help the people. For
          which one are you killing me?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>They replied, "Not for any good work, but
        for blasphemy; you, a mere man, have declared yourself to be God."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34,35,36</span>"In your own Law it says that men
        are gods!" <span>he replied. </span>"So if the Scripture, which cannot
        be untrue, speaks of those as gods to whom the message of God came, do
        you call it blasphemy when the one sanctified and sent into the world by
        the Father says, 'I am the Son of God'? <span className="sup">37</span>
        Don't believe me unless I do miracles of God.{' '}
        <span className="sup">38</span>But if I do, believe them even if you
        don't believe me. Then you will become convinced that the Father is in
        me, and I in the Father."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Once again they started to arrest him.
        But he walked away and left them, <span className="sup">40</span>and
        went beyond the Jordan River to stay near the place where John was first
        baptizing.
        <span className="sup">41</span>And many followed him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "John didn't do miracles," they remarked to one another, "but all his
        predictions concerning this man have come true."
        <span className="sup">42</span>And many came to the decision that he was
        the Messiah.
