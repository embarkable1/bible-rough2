      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard about the greater crowds
        coming to him than to John to be baptized and to become his
        disciples--(though Jesus himself didn't baptize them, but his disciples
        did)-- <span className="sup">3</span>he left Judea and returned to the
        province of Galilee.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>He had to go through Samaria on the way,
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>and around noon as he approached the
        village of Sychar, he came to Jacob's Well, located on the parcel of
        ground Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jesus was tired from the long walk
        in the hot sun and sat wearily beside the wall.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water,
        and Jesus asked her for a drink. <span className="sup">8</span>He was
        alone at the time as his disciples had gone into the village to buy some
        food.
        <span className="sup">9</span>The woman was surprised that a Jew would
        ask a "despised Samaritan" for anything--usually they wouldn't even
        speak to them!--and she remarked about this to Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you only knew what a wonderful gift God has for you, and who I am,
          you would ask me for some <em>living</em> water!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"But you don't have a rope or a bucket,"
        she said, "and this is a very deep well! Where would you get this living
        water? <span className="sup">12</span>And besides, are you greater than
        our ancestor Jacob? How can you offer better water than this which he
        and his sons and cattle enjoyed?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Jesus replied that people soon became
        thirsty again after drinking this water. <span className="sup">14</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "But the water I give them," <span>he said, </span>"becomes a
          perpetual spring within them, watering them forever with eternal
          life."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"Please, sir," the woman said, "give me
        some of that water! Then I'll never be thirsty again and won't have to
        make this long trip out here every day."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Go and get your husband,"</span> Jesus told her.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17,18</span>"But I'm not married," the woman
        replied.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">
          "All too true!" <span>Jesus said. </span>"For you have had five
          husbands, and you aren't even married to the man you're living with
          now."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Sir," the woman said, "you must be a
        prophet. <span className="sup">20</span>But say, tell me, why is it that
        you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship, while we
        Samaritans claim it is here [at Mount Gerizim], where our ancestors
        worshipped?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21-24</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The time is coming, ma'am, when we will no longer be concerned about
          whether to worship the Father here or in Jerusalem. For it's not
          <em>where</em> we worship that counts, but <em>how</em> we worship--is
          our worship spiritual and real? Do we have the Holy Spirit's help? For
          God is Spirit, and we must have his help to worship as we should. The
          Father wants this kind of worship from us. But you Samaritans know so
          little about him, worshiping blindly, while we Jews know all about
          him, for salvation comes to the world through the Jews."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>The woman said, "Well, at least I know
        that the Messiah will come--the one they call Christ--and when he does,
        he will explain everything to us."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then Jesus told her,
        <span class="jesus">"I am the Messiah!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Just then his disciples arrived. They
        were surprised to find him talking to a woman, but none of them asked
        him why, or what they had been discussing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28,29</span>Then the woman left her waterpot
        beside the well and went back to the village and told everyone, "Come
        and meet a man who told me everything I ever did! Can this be the
        Messiah?
        <span className="sup">30</span>So the people came streaming from the
        village to see him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Meanwhile, the disciples were urging
        Jesus to eat. <span className="sup">32</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "No," <span>he said, </span>"I have some food you don't know about."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"Who brought it to him?" the disciples
        asked each other.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Then Jesus explained:
        <span class="jesus">
          "My nourishment comes from doing the will of God who sent me, and from
          finishing his work.{' '}
          <sup>
            <span>35</span>{' '}
          </sup>
          Do you think the work of harvesting will not begin until the summer
          ends four months from now? Look around you! Vast fields of human souls
          are ripening all around us, and are ready now for reaping.
          <sup>
            <span>36</span>{' '}
          </sup>
          The reapers will be paid good wages and will be gathering eternal
          souls into the granaries of heaven! What joys await the sower and the
          reaper, both together!
          <sup>
            <span>37</span>{' '}
          </sup>
          For it is true that one sows and someone else reaps.{' '}
          <sup>
            <span>38</span>{' '}
          </sup>
          I sent you to reap where you didn't sow; others did the work, and you
          received the harvest."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Many from the Samaritan village believed
        he was the Messiah because of the woman's report: "He told me everything
        I ever did!" <span className="sup">40,41</span>When they came out to see
        him at the well, they begged him to stay at their village; and he did,
        for two days, long enough for many of them to believe in him after
        hearing him. <span className="sup">42</span>Then they said to the woman,
        "Now we believe because we have heard him ourselves, not just because of
        what you told us. He is indeed the Savior of the world."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>At the end of the two days' stay he
        went on into Galilee. Jesus used to say, "A prophet is honored
        everywhere except in his own country!" <span className="sup">45</span>
        But the Galileans welcomed him with open arms, for they had been in
        Jerusalem at the Passover celebration and had seen some of his miracles.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46,47</span>In the course of his journey through
        Galilee he arrived at the town of Cana, where he had turned the water
        into wine. While he was there, a man in the city of Capernaum, a
        government official, whose son was very sick, heard that Jesus had come
        from Judea and was traveling in Galilee. This man went over to Cana,
        found Jesus, and begged him to come to Capernaum with him and heal his
        son, who was now at death's door.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>Jesus asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Won't any of you believe in me unless I do more and more miracles?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>The official pled, "Sir, please come now
        before my child dies."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Then Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">"Go back home. Your son is healed!" </span>And the
        man believed Jesus and started home. <span className="sup">51</span>
        While he was on his way, some of his servants met him with the news that
        all was well--his son had recovered. <span className="sup">52</span>He
        asked them when the lad had begun to feel better, and they replied,
        "Yesterday afternoon at about one o'clock his fever suddenly
        disappeared!"
        <span className="sup">53</span>Then the father realized it was the same
        moment that Jesus had told him, "Your son is healed." And the officer
        and his entire household believed that Jesus was the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>This was Jesus' second miracle in Galilee
        after coming from Judea.
