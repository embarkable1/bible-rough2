      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        After saying these things Jesus crossed the Kidron ravine with his
        disciples and entered a grove of olive trees.
        <span className="sup">2</span>Judas, the betrayer, knew this place, for
        Jesus had gone there many times with his disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>The chief priests and Pharisees had given
        Judas a squad of soldiers and police to accompany him. Now with blazing
        torches, lanterns, and weapons they arrived at the olive grove.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4,5</span>Jesus fully realized all that was going
        to happen to him. Stepping forward to meet them he asked,
        <span class="jesus">"Whom are you looking for?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Jesus of Nazareth," they replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"I am he," </span>Jesus said.
        <span className="sup">6</span>And as he said it, they all fell backwards
        to the ground!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Once more he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Whom are you searching for?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">And again they replied, "Jesus of Nazareth."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "I told you I am he," <span>Jesus said;</span> "and since I am the one
          you are after, let these others go."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">9</span>He did this to carry out the prophecy he
        had just made, "I have not lost a single one of those you gave me . . .
        ."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then Simon Peter drew a sword and slashed
        off the right ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>But Jesus said to Peter,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Put your sword away. Shall I not drink from the cup the Father has
          given me?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>So the Jewish police, with the soldiers
        and their lieutenant, arrested Jesus and tied him.
        <span className="sup">13</span>First they took him to Annas, the
        father-in-law of Caiaphas, the High Priest that year.
        <span className="sup">14</span>Caiaphas was the one who told the other
        Jewish leaders, "Better that one should die for all."
        <span className="sup">15</span>Simon Peter followed along behind, as did
        another of the disciples who was acquainted with the High Priest. So
        that other disciple was permitted into the courtyard along with Jesus,
        <span className="sup">16</span>while Peter stood outside the gate. Then
        the other disciple spoke to the girl watching at the gate, and she let
        Peter in. <span className="sup">17</span>The girl asked Peter, "Aren't
        you one of Jesus' disciples?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"No," he said, "I am not!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>The police and the household servants
        were standing around a fire they had made, for it was cold. And Peter
        stood there with them, warming himself.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Inside, the High Priest began asking
        Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">20</span>Jesus replied,{' '}
        </span>
        "What I teach is widely known, for I have preached regularly in the
        synagogue and Temple; I have been heard by all the Jewish leaders and
        teach nothing in private that I have not said in public.{' '}
        <span className="sup">21</span>Why are you asking me this question? Ask
        those who heard me. You have some of them here. They know what I said."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>One of the soldiers standing there struck
        Jesus with his fist. "Is that the way to answer the High Priest?" he
        demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "If I lied, prove it," <span>Jesus replied. </span>"Should you hit a
          man for telling the truth?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Then Annas sent Jesus, bound, to Caiaphas
        the High Priest.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by
        the fire, he was asked again, "Aren't you one of his disciples?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Of course not," he replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>But one of the household slaves of the
        High Priest--a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off--asked,
        "Didn't I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Again Peter denied it. And immediately a
        rooster crowed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Jesus' trial before Caiaphas ended in the
        early hours of the morning. Next he was taken to the palace of the Roman
        governor. His accusers wouldn't go in themselves for that would "defile"
        them, they said, and they wouldn't be allowed to eat the Passover lamb.
        <span className="sup">29</span>So Pilate, the governor, went out to them
        and asked, "What is your charge against this man? What are you accusing
        him of doing?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"We wouldn't have arrested him if he
        weren't a criminal!" they retorted.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Then take him away and judge him
        yourselves by your own laws," Pilate told them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "But we want him crucified," they demanded, "and your approval is
        required." <span className="sup">32</span>This fulfilled Jesus'
        prediction concerning the method of his execution.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Then Pilate went back into the palace and
        called for Jesus to be brought to him. "Are you the King of the Jews?"
        he asked him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "'King' as <em>you</em> use the word or as the <em>Jews</em> use it?"
        </span>
        Jesus asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>"Am I a Jew?" Pilate retorted. "Your own
        people and their chief priests brought you here. Why? What have you
        done?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then Jesus answered,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am not an earthly king. If I were, my followers would have fought
          when I was arrested by the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom is not of
          the world."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Pilate replied, "But you are a king
        then?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Yes," <span>Jesus said. </span>"I was born for that purpose. And I came
        to bring truth to the world. All who love the truth are my followers."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"What is truth?" Pilate exclaimed. Then
        he went out again to the people and told them, "He is not guilty of any
        crime. <span className="sup">39</span>But you have a custom of asking me
        to release someone from prison each year at Passover. So if you want me
        to, I'll release the 'King of the Jews.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>But they screamed back, "No! Not this
        man, but Barabbas!" Barabbas was a robber.
      </p>
