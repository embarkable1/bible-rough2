      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        After this, Jesus went to Galilee, going from village to village, for he
        wanted to stay out of Judea where the Jewish leaders were plotting his
        death. <span className="sup">2</span>But soon it was time for the
        Tabernacle Ceremonies, one of the annual Jewish holidays,
        <span className="sup">3</span>and Jesus' brothers urged him to go to
        Judea for the celebration.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Go where more people can see your miracles!" they scoffed.
        <span className="sup">4</span>"You can't be famous when you hide like
        this! If you're so great, prove it to the world!"
        <span className="sup">5</span>For even his brothers didn't believe in
        him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is not the right time for me to go now. But you can go anytime and
          it will make no difference, <span className="sup">7</span>for the
          world can't hate you; but it does hate me, because I accuse it of sin
          and evil. <span className="sup">8</span>You go on, and I'll come later
          when it is the right time."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">9</span>So he remained in Galilee.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>But after his brothers had left for the
        celebration, then he went too, though secretly, staying out of the
        public eye. <span className="sup">11</span>The Jewish leaders tried to
        find him at the celebration and kept asking if anyone had seen him.
        <span className="sup">12</span>There was a lot of discussion about him
        among the crowds. Some said, "He's a wonderful man," while others said,
        "No, he's duping the public." <span className="sup">13</span>But no one
        had the courage to speak out for him in public for fear of reprisals
        from the Jewish leaders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then, midway through the festival, Jesus
        went up to the Temple and preached openly.{' '}
        <span className="sup">15</span>The Jewish leaders were surprised when
        they heard him. "How can he know so much when he's never been to our
        schools?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>So Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I'm not teaching you my own thoughts, but those of God who sent me.
          <span className="sup">17</span>If any of you really determines to do
          God's will, then you will certainly know whether my teaching is from
          God or is merely my own. <span className="sup">18</span>Anyone
          presenting his own ideas is looking for praise for himself, but anyone
          seeking to honor the one who sent him is a good and true person.
          <span className="sup">19</span>None of <em>you</em> obeys the laws of
          Moses! So why pick on <em>me</em> for breaking them? Why kill
          <em>me</em> for this?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>The crowd replied, "You're out of your
        mind! Who's trying to kill you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21,22,23</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I worked on the Sabbath by healing a man, and you were surprised. But
          you work on the Sabbath, too, whenever you obey Moses' law of
          circumcision (actually, however, this tradition of circumcision is
          older than the Mosaic law); for if the correct time for circumcising
          your children falls on the Sabbath, you go ahead and do it, as you
          should. So why should I be condemned for making a man completely well
          on the Sabbath? <span className="sup">24</span>Think this through and
          you will see that I am right."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Some of the people who lived there in
        Jerusalem said among themselves, "Isn't this the man they are trying to
        kill? <span className="sup">26</span>But here he is preaching in public,
        and they say nothing to him. Can it be that our leaders have learned,
        after all, that he really is the Messiah?{' '}
        <span className="sup">27</span>But how could he be? For we know where
        this man was born; when Christ comes, he will just appear and no one
        will know where he comes from."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>So Jesus, in a sermon in the Temple,
        called out,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes, you know me and where I was born and raised, but I am the
          representative of one you don't know, and he is Truth.
          <span className="sup">29</span>I know him because I was with him, and
          he sent me to you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Then the Jewish leaders sought to arrest
        him; but no hand was laid on him, for God's time had not yet come.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Many among the crowds at the Temple
        believed on him. "After all," they said, "what miracles do you expect
        the Messiah to do that this man hasn't done?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>When the Pharisees heard that the crowds
        were in this mood, they and the chief priests sent officers to arrest
        Jesus.
        <span className="sup">33</span>But Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "[Not yet!] I am to be here a little longer. Then I shall return to
          the one who sent me. <span className="sup">34</span>You will search
          for me but not find me. And you won't be able to come where I am!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this
        statement. "Where is he planning to go?" they asked. "Maybe he is
        thinking of leaving the country and going as a missionary among the Jews
        in other lands, or maybe even to the Gentiles!
        <span className="sup">36</span>What does he mean about our looking for
        him and not being able to find him, and, 'You won't be able to come
        where I am'?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>On the last day, the climax of the
        holidays, Jesus shouted to the crowds,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink.
          <span className="sup">38</span>For the Scriptures declare that rivers
          of living water shall flow from the inmost being of anyone who
          believes in me."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">39</span>(He was speaking of the Holy Spirit, who
        would be given to everyone believing in him; but the Spirit had not yet
        been given, because Jesus had not yet returned to his glory in heaven.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>When the crowds heard him say this, some
        of them declared, "This man surely is the prophet who will come just
        before the Messiah." <span className="sup">41,42</span>Others said, "He
        <em>is</em> the Messiah." Still others, "But he <em>can't</em> be! Will
        the Messiah come from <em>Galilee?</em> For the Scriptures clearly state
        that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David, in
        <em>Bethlehem</em>, the village where David was born."
        <span className="sup">43</span>So the crowd was divided about him.
        <span className="sup">44</span>And some wanted him arrested, but no one
        touched him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>The Temple police who had been sent to
        arrest him returned to the chief priests and Pharisees. "Why didn't you
        bring him in?" they demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>"He says such wonderful things!" they
        mumbled. "We've never heard anything like it."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>"So you also have been led astray?" the
        Pharisees mocked. <span className="sup">48</span>"Is there a single one
        of us Jewish rulers or Pharisees who believes he is the Messiah?
        <span className="sup">49</span>These stupid crowds do, yes; but what do
        they know about it? A curse upon them anyway!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Then Nicodemus spoke up. (Remember him?
        He was the Jewish leader who came secretly to interview Jesus.)
        <span className="sup">51</span>"Is it legal to convict a man before he
        is even tried?" he asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>They replied, "Are you a wretched
        Galilean too? Search the Scriptures and see for yourself--no prophets
        will come from Galilee!" <span className="sup">53</span>Then the meeting
        broke up and everybody went home.
      </p>
