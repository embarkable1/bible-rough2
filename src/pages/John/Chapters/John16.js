      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "I have told you these things so that you won't be staggered [by all
        that lies ahead.] <span className="sup">2</span>For you will be
        excommunicated from the synagogues, and indeed the time is coming when
        those who kill you will think they are doing God a service.
        <span className="sup">3</span>This is because they have never known the
        Father or me. <span className="sup">4</span>Yes, I'm telling you these
        things now so that when they happen you will remember I warned you. I
        didn't tell you earlier because I was going to be with you for a while
        longer.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"But now I am going away to the one who
        sent me; and none of you seems interested in the purpose of my going;
        none wonders why. <span className="sup">6</span>Instead you are only
        filled with sorrow. <span className="sup">7</span>But the fact of the
        matter is that it is best for you that I go away, for if I don't, the
        Comforter won't come. If I do, he will--for I will send him to you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"And when he has come he will convince the
        world of its sin, and of the availability of God's goodness, and of
        deliverance from judgment. <span className="sup">9</span>The world's sin
        is unbelief in me; <span className="sup">10</span>there is righteousness
        available because I go the Father and you shall see me no more;
        <span className="sup">11</span>there is deliverance from judgment
        because the prince of this world has already been judged.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Oh, there is so much more I want to tell
        you, but you can't understand it now. <span className="sup">13</span>
        When the Holy Spirit, who is truth, comes, he shall guide you into all
        truth, for he will not be presenting his own ideas, but will be passing
        on to you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.
        <span className="sup">14</span>He shall praise me and bring me great
        honor by showing you my glory. <span className="sup">15</span>All the
        Father's glory is mine; this is what I mean when I say that he will show
        you my glory. <span className="sup">16</span>In just a little while I
        will be gone, and you will see me no more; but just a little while after
        that, and you will see me again!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17,18</span>"Whatever is he saying?" some of his
        disciples asked. "What is this about 'going to Father'? We don't know
        what he means."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus realized they wanted to ask him so
        he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Are you asking yourselves what I mean?
          <span className="sup">20</span>The world will greatly rejoice over
          what is going to happen to me, and you will weep. But your weeping
          shall suddenly be turned to wonderful joy [when you see me again].
          <span className="sup">21</span>It will be the same joy as that of a
          woman in labor when her child is born--her anguish gives place to
          rapturous joy and the pain is forgotten.{' '}
          <span className="sup">22</span>You have sorrow now, but I will see you
          again and then you will rejoice; and no one can rob you of that joy.{' '}
          <span className="sup">23</span>At that time you won't need to ask me
          for anything, for you can go directly to the Father and ask him, and
          he will give what you ask for because you use my name.{' '}
          <span className="sup">24</span>You haven't tried this before, [but
          begin now]. Ask, using my name, and you will receive, and your cup of
          joy will overflow.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"I have spoken of these matters very
        guardedly, but the time will come when this will not be necessary and I
        will tell you plainly all about the Father.
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then you will present your petitions over
        my signature! And I won't need to ask the Father to grant you these
        requests, <span className="sup">27</span>for the Father himself loves
        you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from the Father.
        <span className="sup">28</span>Yes, I came from the Father into the
        world and will leave the world and return to the Father."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"At last you are speaking plainly," his
        disciples said, "and not in riddles. <span className="sup">30</span>Now
        we understand that you know everything and don't need anyone to tell you
        anything. From this we believe that you came from God."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Do you finally believe this?"
        <span>
          Jesus asked. <span className="sup">32</span>{' '}
        </span>
        "But the time is coming--in fact, it is here--when you will be
        scattered, each one returning to his own home, leaving me alone. Yet I
        will not be alone, for the Father is with me.{' '}
        <span className="sup">33</span>I have told you all this so that you will
        have peace of heart and mind. Here on earth you will have many trials
        and sorrows; but cheer up, for I have overcome the world."
