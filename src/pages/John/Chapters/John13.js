      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus knew on the evening of Passover Day that it would be his last
        night on earth before returning to his Father. During supper the devil
        had already suggested to Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, that this was the
        night to carry out his plan to betray Jesus. Jesus knew that the Father
        had given him everything and that he had come from God and would return
        to God. And how he loved his disciples! <span className="sup">4</span>So
        he got up from the supper table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel
        around his loins, <span className="sup">5</span>poured water into a
        basin, and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the
        towel he had around him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to
        him, "Master, you shouldn't be washing our feel like this!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You don't understand now why I am doing it; some day you will."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"No," Peter protested, "you shall never
        wash my feet!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "But if I don't, you can't be my partner," <span>Jesus replied.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash my hands
        and head as well--not just my feet!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "One who has bathed all over needs only to have his feet washed to be
          entirely clean. Now you are clean--but that isn't true of everyone
          here."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">11</span>For Jesus knew who would betray him. That
        is what he mean when he said,
        <span class="jesus">"Not all of you are clean."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>After washing their feet he put on his
        robe again and sat down and asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Do you understand what I was doing? <span className="sup">13</span>
          You call me 'Master' and 'Lord,' and you do well to say it, for it is
          true. <span className="sup">14</span>And since I, the Lord and
          Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.
          <span className="sup">15</span>I have given you an example to follow:
          do as I have done to you. <span className="sup">16</span>How true it
          is that a servant is not greater than his master. Nor is the messenger
          more important than the one who sends him.{' '}
          <span className="sup">17</span>You know these things--now do them!
          That is the path of blessing.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"I am not saying these things to all of
        you; I know so well each one of you I chose. The Scripture declares,
        'One who eats supper with me will betray me,' and this will soon come
        true.
        <span className="sup">19</span>I tell you this now so that when it
        happens, you will believe on me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"Truly, anyone welcoming my messenger is
        welcoming me. And to welcome me is to welcome the Father who sent me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Now Jesus was in great anguish of spirit
        and exclaimed,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes, it is true--one of you will betray me."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">22</span>The disciples looked at each other,
        wondering whom he could mean. <span className="sup">23</span>Since I was
        sitting next to Jesus at the table, being his closest friend,
        <span className="sup">24</span>Simon Peter motioned to me to ask him who
        it was who would do this terrible deed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>So I turned and asked him, "Lord, who is
        it?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>He told me,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is the one I honor by giving the bread dipped in the sauce."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And when he had dipped it, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>As soon as Judas had eaten it, Satan
        entered into him. Then Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">"Hurry--do it now."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>None of the others at the table knew what
        Jesus meant. <span className="sup">29</span>Some thought that since
        Judas was their treasurer, Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the
        food or to give some money to the poor. <span className="sup">30</span>
        Judas left at once, going out into the night.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>As soon as Judas left the room, Jesus
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My time has come; the glory of God will soon surround me--and God
          shall receive the great praise because of all that happens to me.
          <span className="sup">32</span>And God shall give me his own glory,
          and this so very soon. <span className="sup">33</span>Dear, dear
          children, how brief are these moments before I must go away and leave
          you! Then, though you search for me, you cannot come to me--just as I
          told the Jewish leaders.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"And so I am giving a new commandment to
        you now--love each other just as much as I love you.
        <span className="sup">35</span>Your strong love for each other will
        prove to the world that you are my disciples."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Simon Peter said, "Master, where are you
        going?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You can't go with me now, but you will follow me later."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"But why can't I come now?" he asked,
        "for I am ready to die for you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Jesus answered,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Die for me? No--three times before the cock crows tomorrow morning,
          you will deny that you even know me!
