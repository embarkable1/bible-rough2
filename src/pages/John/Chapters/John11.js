      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Do you remember Mary, who poured the costly perfume on Jesus' feet and
        wiped them her hair? Well, her brother Lazarus, who lived in Bethany
        with Mary and her sister Martha, was sick.{' '}
        <span className="sup">3</span>So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus
        telling him, "Sir, your good friend is very, very sick."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>But when Jesus heard about it he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The purpose of his illness is not death, but for the glory of God. I,
          the Son of God, will receive glory from this situation."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Although Jesus was very fond of Martha,
        Mary, and Lazarus, <span className="sup">6</span>he stayed where he was
        for the next two days and made no move to go to them.
        <span className="sup">7</span>Finally, after the two days, he said to
        his disciples, <span class="jesus">"Let's go to Judea."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>But the disciples objected. "Master," they
        said, "only a few days ago the Jewish leaders in Judea were trying to
        kill you. Are you going there again?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "There are twelve hours of daylight every day, and during every hour
          of it a man can walk safely and not stumble.
          <span className="sup">10</span>Only at night is there danger of a
          wrong step, because of the dark."
          <span>
            <span className="sup">11</span>Then he said,{' '}
          </span>
          "Our friend Lazarus has gone to sleep, but now I will go and waken
          him!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>The disciples, thinking Jesus meant
        Lazarus was having a good night's rest, said, "That means he is getting
        better!" But Jesus meant Lazarus had died.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then he told them plainly,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Lazarus is dead. <span className="sup">15</span>And for your sake, I
          am glad I wasn't there, for this will give you another opportunity to
          believe in me. Come, let's go to him."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Thomas, nicknamed "The Twin," said to his
        fellow disciples, "Let's go too--and die with him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>When they arrived at Bethany, they were
        told that Lazarus had already been in this tomb for four days.
        <span className="sup">18</span>Bethany was only a couple of miles down
        the road from Jerusalem, <span className="sup">19</span>and many of the
        Jewish leaders had come to pay their respects and to console Martha and
        Mary on their loss. <span className="sup">20</span>When Martha got word
        that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed at home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Martha said to Jesus, "Sir, if you had
        been here, my brother wouldn't have died.{' '}
        <span className="sup">22</span>And even now it's not too late, for I
        know that God will bring my brother back to life again, if you will only
        ask him to."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus told her,
        <span class="jesus">"Your brother will come back to life again."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"Yes," Martha said, "when everyone else
        does, on Resurrection Day."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Jesus told her,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am the one who raises the dead and gives them life again. Anyone
          who believes in me, even though he dies like anyone else, shall live
          again. <span className="sup">26</span>He is given eternal life for
          believing in me and shall never perish. Do you believe this, Martha?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Yes, Master," she told him. "I believe
        you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one we have so long awaited."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Then she left him and returned to Mary
        and, calling her aside from the mourners, told her, "He is here and
        wants to see you." <span className="sup">29</span>So Mary went to him at
        once.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Now Jesus had stayed outside the village,
        at the place where Martha met him. <span className="sup">31</span>When
        the Jewish leaders who were at the house trying to console Mary saw her
        leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus' tomb to weep;
        so they followed her.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>When Mary arrived where Jesus was, she
        fell down at his feet, saying, "Sir, if you had been here, my brother
        would still be alive."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>When Jesus saw her weeping and the Jewish
        leaders wailing with her, he was moved with indignation and deeply
        troubled. <span className="sup">34</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Where is he buried?"</span> he asked them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        They told him, "Come and see." <span className="sup">35</span>Tears came
        to Jesus' eyes.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"They were close friends," the Jewish
        leaders said. "See how much he loved him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>But some said, "This fellow healed a
        blind man--why couldn't he keep Lazarus from dying?" And again Jesus was
        moved with deep anger. Then they came to the tomb. It was a cave with
        heavy stone rolled across its door.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Roll the stone aside,"</span> Jesus told them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        But Martha, the dead man's sister, said, "By now the smell will be
        terrible, for he has been dead four days."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "But didn't I tell you that you will see a wonderful miracle from God
          if you believe?"{' '}
        </span>
        Jesus asked her.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>So they rolled the stone aside. Then
        Jesus looked up to heaven and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Father, thank you for hearing me. <span className="sup">42</span>(You
          always hear me, of course, but I said it because of all these people
          standing here, so that they will believe you sent me.)"
          <span>
            <span className="sup">43</span>Then he shouted,{' '}
          </span>
          "Lazarus, come out!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>And Lazarus came--bound up in the
        gravecloth, his face muffled in a head swath. Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">"Unwrap him and let him go!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>And so at last many of the Jewish leaders
        who were with Mary and saw it happen, finally believed on him.
        <span className="sup">46</span>But some went away to the Pharisees and
        reported it to them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>Then the chief priests and Pharisees
        convened a council to discuss the situation.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "What are we going to do?" they asked each other. "For this man
        certainly does miracles. <span className="sup">48</span>If we let him
        alone the whole nation will follow him--and then the Roman army will
        come and kill us and take over the Jewish government."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>And one of them, Caiaphas, who was High
        Priest that year, said, "You stupid idiots--
        <span className="sup">50</span>let this one man die for the people--why
        should the whole nation perish?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>This prophecy that Jesus should die for
        the entire nation came from Caiaphas in his position as High Priest--he
        didn't think of it by himself, but was inspired to say it.
        <span className="sup">52</span>It was a prediction that Jesus' death
        would not be for Israel only, but for all the children of God scattered
        around the world. <span className="sup">53</span>So from that time on
        the Jewish leaders began plotting Jesus' death.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>Jesus now stopped his public ministry and
        left Jerusalem; he went to the edge of the desert, to the village of
        Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>The Passover, a Jewish holy day, was
        near, and many country people arrived in Jerusalem several days early so
        that they could go through the cleansing ceremony before the Passover
        began.
        <span className="sup">56</span>They wanted to see Jesus, and as they
        gossiped in the Temple, they asked each other, "What do you think? Will
        he come for the Passover?" <span className="sup">57</span>Meanwhile the
        chief priests and Pharisees had publicly announced that anyone seeing
        Jesus must report him immediately so that they could arrest him.
