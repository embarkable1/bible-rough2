      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "I am the true Vine, and my Father is the Gardener.
        <span className="sup">2</span>He lops off every branch that doesn't
        produce. And he prunes those branches that bear fruit for even larger
        crops.
        <span className="sup">3</span>He has already tended you by pruning you
        back for greater strength and usefulness by means of the commands I gave
        you.
        <span className="sup">4</span>Take care to live in me, and let me live
        in you. For a branch can't produce fruit when severed from the vine. Nor
        can you be fruitful apart from me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Yes, I am the Vine, you are the branches.
        Whoever lives in me and I in him shall produce a large crop of fruit.
        For apart from me you can't do a thing. <span className="sup">6</span>If
        anyone separates from me, he is thrown away like a useless branch,
        withers, and is gathered into a pile with all the others and burned.
        <span className="sup">7</span>But if you stay in me and obey my
        commands, you may ask any request you like, and it will be granted!
        <span className="sup">8</span>My true disciples produce bountiful
        harvests. This brings great glory to my Father.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"I have loved you even as the Father has
        loved me. Live within my love. <span className="sup">10</span>When you
        obey me you are living in my love, just as I obey my Father and live in
        his love.
        <span className="sup">11</span>I have told you this so that you will be
        filled with my joy. Yes, your cup of joy will overflow!
        <span className="sup">12</span>I demand that you love each other as much
        as I love you. <span className="sup">13</span>And here is how to measure
        it--the greatest love is shown when a person lays down his life for his
        friends; <span className="sup">14</span>and you are my friends if you
        obey me. <span className="sup">15</span>I no longer call you slaves, for
        a master doesn't confide in his slaves; now you are my friends, proved
        by the fact that I have told you everything the Father told me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"You didn't choose me! I chose you! I
        appointed you to go and produce lovely fruit always, so that no matter
        what you ask for from the Father, using my name, he will give it to you.
        <span className="sup">17</span>I demand that you love each other,
        <span className="sup">18</span>for you get enough hate from the world!
        But then, it hated me before it hated you.{' '}
        <span className="sup">19</span>The world would love you if you belonged
        to it; but you don't--for I chose you to come out of the world, and so
        it hates you.
        <span className="sup">20</span>Do you remember what I told you? 'A slave
        isn't greater than his master!' So since they persecuted me, naturally
        they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would
        listen to you! <span className="sup">21</span>The people of the world
        will persecute you because you belong to me, for they don't know God who
        sent me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"They would not be guilty if I had not
        come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.
        <span className="sup">23</span>Anyone hating me is also hating my
        Father.
        <span className="sup">24</span>If I hadn't done such mighty miracles
        among them they would not be counted guilty. But as it is, they saw
        these miracles and yet they hated both of us--me and my Father.
        <span className="sup">25</span>This has fulfilled what the prophets said
        concerning the Messiah, 'They hated me without reason.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But I will send you the Comforter--the
        Holy Spirit, the source of all truth. He will come to you from the
        Father and will tell you all about me. <span className="sup">27</span>
        And you also must tell everyone about me, because you have been with me
        from the beginning.
