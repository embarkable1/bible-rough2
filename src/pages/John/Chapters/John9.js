      <p className="quote">
        As he was walking along, he saw a man blind from birth.
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Master," his disciples asked him, "why
        was this man born blind? Was it a result of his own sins or those of
        this parents?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Neither," <span>Jesus answered. </span>"But to demonstrate the power
          of God. <span className="sup">4</span>All of us must quickly carry out
          the tasks assigned us by the one who sent me, for there is little time
          left before the night falls and all work comes to an end.
          <span className="sup">5</span>But while I am still here in the world,
          I give it my light."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Then he spat on the ground and made mud
        from the spittle and smoothed the mud over the blind man's eyes,
        <span className="sup">7</span>and told him,
        <span class="jesus">"Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam" </span>(the word
        "Siloam" means "Sent"). So the man went where he was sent and washed and
        came back seeing!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>His neighbors and others who knew him as a
        blind beggar asked each other, "Is this the same fellow--that beggar?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Some said yes, and some said no. "It can't
        be the same man," they thought, "but he surely looks like him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And the beggar said, "I <em>am</em> the same man!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then they asked him how in the world he
        could see. What had happened?
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And he told them, "A man they call Jesus
        made mud and smoothed it over my eyes and told me to go to the Pool of
        Siloam and wash off the mud. I did, and I can see!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Where is he now?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"I don't know," he replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then they took the man to the Pharisees.
        <span className="sup">14</span>Now as it happened, this all occurred on
        a Sabbath. <span className="sup">15</span>Then the Pharisees asked him
        all about it. So he told them how Jesus had smoothed the mud over his
        eyes, and when it was washed away, he could see!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Some of them said, "Then this fellow
        Jesus is not from God, because he is working on the Sabbath."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Others said, "But how could an ordinary sinner do such miracles?" So
        there was a deep division of opinion among them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Then the Pharisees turned on the man who
        had been blind and demanded, "This man who opened your eyes--who do you
        say he is?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "I think he must be a prophet sent from God," the man replied.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>The Jewish leaders wouldn't believe he
        had been blind, until they called in his parents
        <span className="sup">19</span>and asked them, "Is this your son? Was he
        born blind? If so, how can he see?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>His parents replied, "We know this is our
        son and the he was born blind, <span className="sup">21</span>but we
        don't know what happened to make him see, or who did it. He is old
        enough to speak for himself. Ask him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>They said this in fear of the Jewish
        leaders who had announced that anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would
        be excommunicated.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>So for the second time they called in the
        man who had been blind and told him, "Give the glory to God, not to
        Jesus, for we know Jesus is an evil person."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"I don't know whether he is good or bad,"
        the man replied, "but I know this: <em>I was blind, and now I see!</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But what did he do?" they asked. "How
        did he heal you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Look!" the man exclaimed. "I told you
        once; didn't you listen? Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want
        to become his disciples too?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Then they cursed him and said, "You are
        his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>We know God has spoken to Moses, but as
        for this fellow, we don't know anything about him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"Why, that's very strange!" the man
        replied. "He can heal blind men, and yet you don't know anything about
        him!
        <span className="sup">31</span>Well, God doesn't listen to evil men, but
        he has open ears to those worship him and do his will.
        <span className="sup">32</span>Since the world began there has never
        been anyone who could open the eyes of someone born blind.
        <span className="sup">33</span>If this man were not from God, he
        couldn't do it."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"You illegitimate bastard, you!" they
        shouted. "Are you trying to teach <em>us?</em>" And they threw him out.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>When Jesus heard what had happened, he
        found the man and said,
        <span class="jesus">"Do you believe in the Messiah?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>The man answered, "Who is he, sir, for I
        want to."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "You have seen him," <span>Jesus said, </span>"and he is speaking to
          you!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"Yes, Lord," the man said, "I believe!"
        And he worshipped Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Then Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I have come into the world to give sight to those who are spiritually
          blind and to show those who think they see that they are blind."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>The Pharisees who were standing there
        asked, "Are you saying we are blind?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty,"
          <span>Jesus replied, </span>"But your guilt remains because you claim
          to know what you are doing.
