      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Six days before the Passover ceremonies began, Jesus arrived in Bethany
        where Lazarus was--the man he had brought back to life.
        <span className="sup">2</span>A banquet was prepared in Jesus' honor.
        Martha served, and Lazarus sat at the table with him.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Then Mary took a jar of costly perfume
        made from essence of nard, and anointed Jesus' feet with it and wiped
        them with her hair. And the house was filled with fragrance.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>But Judas Iscariot, one of his
        disciples--the one who would betray him--said,{' '}
        <span className="sup">5</span>"That perfume was worth a fortune. It
        should have been sold and the money given to the poor."{' '}
        <span className="sup">6</span>Not that he cared for the poor, but he was
        in charge of the disciples' funds and often dipped into them for his own
        use!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let her alone. She did it in preparation for my burial.
          <span className="sup">8</span>You can always help the poor, but I
          won't be with you very long."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>When the ordinary people of Jerusalem
        heard of his arrival, they flocked to see him and also to see
        Lazarus--the man who had come back to life again.{' '}
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then the chief priests decided to kill
        Lazarus too,
        <span className="sup">11</span>for it was because of him that many of
        the Jewish leaders had deserted and believed in Jesus as their Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>The next day, the news that Jesus was on
        the way to Jerusalem swept through the city, and a huge crowd of
        Passover visitors <span className="sup">13</span>took palm branches and
        went down the road to meet him, shouting, "The Savior! God bless the
        King of Israel! Hail to God's Ambassador!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Jesus rode along on a young donkey,
        fulfilling the prophecy that said: <span className="sup">15</span>"Don't
        be afraid of your King, people of Israel, for he will come to you
        meekly, sitting on a donkey's colt!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>(His disciples didn't realize at the time
        that this was a fulfillment of prophecy; but after Jesus returned to his
        glory in heaven, then they noticed how many prophecies of Scripture had
        come true before their eyes.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>And those in the crowd who had seen Jesus
        call Lazarus back to life were telling all about it.
        <span className="sup">18</span>That was the main reason why so many went
        out to meet him--because they had heard about this mighty miracle.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Then the Pharisees said to each other,
        "We've lost. Look--the whole world has gone after him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem to
        attend the Passover <span className="sup">21</span>paid a visit to
        Philip, who was from Bethsaida, and said, "Sir, we want to meet Jesus."
        <span className="sup">22</span>Philip told Andrew about it, and they
        went together to ask Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23,24</span>Jesus replied that the time had come
        for him to return to his glory in heaven, and that
        <span class="jesus">
          "I must fall and die like a kernel of wheat that falls into the
          furrows of the earth. Unless I die I will be alone--a single seed. But
          my death will produce many new wheat kernels--a plentiful harvest of
          new lives. <span className="sup">25</span>If you love your life down
          here--you will lose it. If you despise your life down here--you will
          exchange it for eternal glory.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"If these Greeks want to be my disciples,
        tell them to come and follow me, for my servants must be where I am. And
        if they follow me, the Father will honor them.
        <span className="sup">27</span>Now my soul is deeply troubled. Shall I
        pray, 'Father, save me from what lies ahead'? But that is the very
        reason why I came! <span className="sup">28</span>Father, bring glory
        and honor to your name."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then a voice spoke from heaven saying, "I have already done this, and I
        will do it again." <span className="sup">29</span>When the crowd heard
        the voice, some of them thought it was thunder, while others declared an
        angel had spoken to him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Then Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The voice was for your benefit, not mine.
          <span className="sup">31</span>The time of judgment for the world has
          come--and the time when Satan, the prince of this world, shall be cast
          out. <span className="sup">32</span>And when I am lifted up [on the
          cross], I will draw everyone to me."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">33</span>He said this to indicate how he was going
        to die.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Die?" asked the crowd. "We understood
        that the Messiah would live forever and never die. Why are you saying he
        will die? What Messiah are you talking about?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My light will shine out for you just a little while longer. Walk in
          it while you can, and go where you want to go before the darkness
          falls, for then it will be too late for you to find your way.
          <span className="sup">36</span>Make use of the Light while there is
          still time; then you will become light bearers."
        </span>
        After saying these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>But despite all the miracles he had done,
        most of the people would not believe he was the Messiah.
        <span className="sup">38</span>This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet
        had predicted: "Lord, who will believe us? Who will accept God's mighty
        miracles as proof?" <span className="sup">39</span>But they couldn't
        believe, for as Isaiah also said: <span className="sup">40</span>"God
        has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts so that they can
        neither see nor understand nor turn to me to heal them."
        <span className="sup">41</span>Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he
        made this prediction, for he had seen a vision of the Messiah's glory.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>However, even many of the Jewish leaders
        believed him to be the Messiah but wouldn't admit it to anyone because
        of their fear that the Pharisees would excommunicate them from the
        synagogue; <span className="sup">43</span>for they loved the praise of
        men more than the praise of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>Jesus shouted to the crowds,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you trust me, you are really trusting God.
          <span className="sup">45</span>For when you see me, you are seeing the
          one who sent me. <span className="sup">46</span>I have come as a Light
          to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me
          will no longer wander in the darkness. <span className="sup">47</span>
          If anyone hears me and doesn't obey me, I am not his judge--for I have
          come to save the world and not to judge it.{' '}
          <span className="sup">48</span>But all who reject me and my message
          will be judged at the Day of Judgment by the truths I have spoken.{' '}
          <span className="sup">49</span>For these are not my own ideas, but I
          have told you what the Father said to tell you.
          <span className="sup">50</span>And I know his instructions lead to
          eternal life; so whatever he tells me to say, I say!"
        </span>
