      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        After this, Jesus crossed over the Sea of Galilee, also know as the Sea
        of Tiberias. <span className="sup">2-5</span>And a huge crowd, many of
        them pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem for the annual Passover
        celebration, were following him wherever he went, to watch him heal the
        sick. So when Jesus went up into the hills and sat down with his
        disciples around him, he soon saw a great multitude of people climbing
        the hill, looking for him
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Turning to Philip he asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Philip, where can we buy bread to feed all these people?"{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">6</span>(He was testing Philip, for he already
        knew what he was going to do.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Philip replied, "It would take a fortune
        to begin to do it!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother,
        spoke up. "There's a youngster here with five barley loaves and a couple
        of fish! But what good is that with all this mob?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Tell everyone to sit down," </span>Jesus ordered.
        And all of them--the approximate count of the men only was 5,000--sat
        down on the grassy slopes. <span className="sup">11</span>Then Jesus
        took the loaves and gave thanks to God and passed them out to the
        people. Afterwards he did the same with the fish. And everyone ate until
        full!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Now gather the scraps," </span>Jesus told his
        disciples, <span class="jesus">"so that nothing is wasted." </span>
        <span className="sup">13</span>And twelve baskets were filled with the
        leftovers!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>When the people realized what a great
        miracle had happened, they exclaimed, "Surely, he is the Prophet we have
        been expecting!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Jesus saw that they were ready to take
        him by force and make him their king, so he went higher into the
        mountains alone.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>That evening his disciples went down to
        the shore to wait for him. <span className="sup">17</span>But as
        darkness fell and Jesus still hadn't come back, they got into the boat
        and headed out across the lake toward Capernaum.{' '}
        <span className="sup">18,19</span>But soon a gale swept down upon them
        as they rowed, and the sea grew very rough. They were three or four
        miles out when suddenly they saw Jesus walking toward the boat! They
        were terrified, <span className="sup">20</span>but he called out to them
        and told them not to be afraid.
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then they were willing to let him in, and
        immediately the boat was where they were going!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>The next morning, back across the
        lake, crowds began gathering on the shore [waiting to see Jesus]. For
        they knew that he and his disciples had come over together and that the
        disciples had gone off in their boat, leaving him behind. Several small
        boats from Tiberias were nearby, <span className="sup">24</span>so when
        the people saw that Jesus wasn't there, nor his disciples, they got into
        the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>When they arrived and found him, they
        said, "Sir, how did you get here?" <span className="sup">26</span>Jesus
        replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The truth of the matter is that you want to be with me because I fed
          you, not because you believe in me. <span className="sup">27</span>But
          you shouldn't be so concerned about perishable things like food. No,
          spend your energy seeking the eternal life that I, the Messiah, can
          give you. For God the Father has sent me for this very purpose."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>They replied, "What should we do to
        satisfy God?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "This is the will of God, that you believe in the one he has sent."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30,31</span>They replied, "You must show us more
        miracles if you want us to believe you are the Messiah. Give us free
        bread every day, like our fathers had while they journeyed through the
        wilderness! As the Scriptures say, 'Moses gave them bread from heaven.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Moses didn't give it to them. My Father did. And now he offers you
          true Bread from heaven. <span className="sup">33</span>The true Bread
          is a Person--the one sent by God from heaven, and he gives life to the
          world."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Sir," they said, "give us that bread
        every day of our lives!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am the Bread of Life. No one coming to me will ever be hungry
          again. Those believing in me will never thirst.
          <span className="sup">36</span>But the trouble is, as I have told you
          before, you haven't believed even though you have seen me.
          <span className="sup">37</span>But some will come to me--those the
          Father has given me--and I will never, never reject them.
          <span className="sup">38</span>For I have come here from heaven to do
          the will of God who sent me, not to have my own way.
          <span className="sup">39</span>And this is the will of God, that I
          should not lose even one of all those he has given me, but that I
          should raise them to eternal life at the Last Day.
          <span className="sup">40</span>For it is my Father's will that
          everyone who sees his Son and believes on him should have eternal
          life--that I should raise him at the Last Day."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then the Jews began to murmur against him
        because he claimed to be the Bread from heaven.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>"What?" they exclaimed. "Why, he is
        merely Jesus the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know. What is
        this he is saying, that he came down from heaven?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't murmur among yourselves about my saying that.
          <span className="sup">44</span>For no one can come to me unless the
          Father who sent me draws him to me, and at the Last Day I will cause
          all such to rise again from the dead. <span className="sup">45</span>
          As it is written in the Scriptures, 'They shall all be taught of God.'
          Those the Father speaks to, who learn the truth from him, will be
          attracted to me. <span className="sup">46</span>(Not that anyone
          actually sees the Father, for only I have seen him.)
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>"How earnestly I tell you this--anyone
        who believes in me already has eternal life!
        <span className="sup">48-51</span>Yes, I am the Bread of Life! When your
        fathers in the wilderness ate bread from the skies, they all died. But
        the Bread from heaven gives eternal life to everyone who eats it. I am
        that Living Bread that came down out of heaven. Anyone eating this Bread
        shall live forever; this Bread is my flesh given to redeem humanity."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>Then the Jews began arguing with each
        other about what he meant. "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"
        they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">53</span>So Jesus said it again,
        <span class="jesus">
          "With all the earnestness I possess I tell you this: Unless you eat
          the flesh of the Messiah and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal
          life within you. <span className="sup">54</span>But anyone who does
          eat my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him
          at the Last Day. <span className="sup">55</span>For my flesh is the
          true food, and my blood is the true drink.{' '}
          <span className="sup">56</span>Everyone who eats my flesh and drinks
          my blood is in me, and I in him.
          <span className="sup">57</span>I live by the power of the living
          Father who sent me, and in the same way those who partake of me shall
          live because of me! <span className="sup">58</span>I am the true Bread
          from heaven; and anyone who eats this Bread shall live forever, and
          not die as your fathers did--though they ate bread from heaven.
          <span>
            <span className="sup">59</span>(He preached this sermon in the
            synagogue in Capernaum.)
          </span>
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>Even his disciples said, "This is very
        hard to understand. Who can tell what he means?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>Jesus knew within himself that his
        disciples were complaining and said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Does <em>this</em> offend you? <span className="sup">62</span>Then
          what will you think if you see me, the Messiah, return to heaven
          again?
          <span className="sup">63</span>Only the Holy Spirit gives eternal
          life. Those born only once, with physical birth, will never receive
          this gift. But now I have told you how to get this true spiritual
          life.
          <span className="sup">64</span>But some of you don't believe me."
        </span>
        (For Jesus knew from the beginning who didn't believe and knew the one
        who would betray him.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>And he remarked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "That is what I meant when I said that no one can come to me unless
          the Father attracts him to me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">66</span>At this point many of his disciples
        turned away and deserted him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">67</span>Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">68</span>Simon Peter replied, "Master, to what

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">70</span>Then Jesus said,

          "I chose the twelve of you, and one is a devil."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">71</span>He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon
