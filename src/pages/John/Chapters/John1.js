      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Before anything else existed, there was Christ, with God. He has always
        been alive and is himself God. <span className="sup">3</span>He created
        everything there is--nothing exists that he didn't make.
        <span className="sup">4</span>Eternal life is in him, and this life
        gives light to all mankind. <span className="sup">5</span>His life is
        the light that shines through the darkness--and the darkness can never
        extinguish it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6,7</span>God sent John the Baptist as a witness
        to the fact that Jesus Christ is the true Light.
        <span className="sup">8</span>John himself was not the Light; he was
        only a witness to identify it. <span className="sup">9</span>Later on,
        the one who is the true Light arrived to shine on everyone coming into
        the world.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>But although he made the world, the world
        didn't recognize him when he came. <span className="sup">11,12</span>
        Even in his own land and among his own people, the Jews, he was not
        accepted. Only a few would welcome and receive him. But to all who
        received him, he gave the right to become children of God. All they
        needed to do was to trust him to save them.{' '}
        <span className="sup">13</span>All those who believe this are
        reborn!--not a physical rebirth resulting from human passion or
        plan--but from the will of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>And Christ became a human being and lived
        here on earth among us and was full of loving forgiveness and truth. And
        some of us have seen his glory--the glory of the only Son of the
        heavenly Father!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>John pointed him out to the people,
        telling the crowds, "This is the one I was talking about when I said,
        'Someone is coming who is greater by far than I am--for he existed long
        before I did!'" <span className="sup">16</span>We have all benefited
        from the rich blessings he brought to us--blessing upon blessing heaped
        upon us!
        <span className="sup">17</span>For Moses gave only the Law with its
        rigid demands and merciless justice, while Jesus Christ brought us
        loving forgiveness as well. <span className="sup">18</span>No one has
        ever actually seen God, but, of course, his only Son has, for he is the
        companion of the Father and has told us all about him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>The Jewish leaders sent priests and
        assistant priests from Jerusalem to ask John whether he claimed to be
        the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>He denied it flatly, "I am not the
        Christ." he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Well then, who are you?" they asked.
        "Are you Elijah?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"No," he replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">"Are you the Prophet?"</p>
      <p className="quote">"No."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"Then who are you? Tell us, so we can
        give an answer to those who sent us. What do you have to say for
        yourself?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>He replied, "I am a voice from the barren
        wilderness, shouting as Isaiah prophesied, 'Get ready for the coming of
        the Lord!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24,25</span>Then those who were sent by the
        Pharisees asked him, "If you aren't the Messiah or Elijah or the
        Prophet, what right do you have to baptize?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>John told them, "I merely baptize with
        water, but right here in the crowd is someone you have never met,
        <span className="sup">27</span>who will soon begin his ministry among
        you, and I am not even fit to be his slave."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>This incident took place at Bethany, a
        village on the other side of the Jordan River where John was baptizing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward
        him and said, "Look! There is the Lamb of God who takes away the world's
        sin! <span className="sup">30</span>He is the one I was talking about
        when I said, 'Soon a man far greater than I am is coming, who existed
        long before me!' <span className="sup">31</span>I didn't know he was the
        one, but I am here baptizing with water in order to point him out to the
        nation of Israel."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Then John told about seeing the Holy
        Spirit in the form of a dove descending from heaven and resting upon
        Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"I didn't know he was the one," John said
        again, "but at the time God sent me to baptize he told me, 'When you see
        the Holy Spirit descending and resting upon someone--he is the one you
        are looking for. He is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
        <span className="sup">34</span>I saw it happen to this man, and I
        therefore testify that he is the Son of God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The following day as John was standing
        with two of his disciples, <span className="sup">36</span>Jesus walked
        by. John looked at him intently and then declared, "See! There is the
        Lamb of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Then John's two disciples turned and
        followed Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Jesus looked around and saw them
        following.
        <span class="jesus">"What do you want?"</span> he asked them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Sir," they replied, "where do you live?"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Come and see," </span>he said. So they went with
        him to the place where he was staying and were with him from about four
        o'clock that afternoon until the evening.
        <span className="sup">40</span>(One of these men was Andrew, Simon
        Peter's brother.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Andrew then went to find his brother
        Peter and told him, "We have found the Messiah!"
        <span className="sup">42</span>And he brought Peter to meet Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus looked intently at Peter for a moment and then said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are Simon, John's son--but you shall be called Peter, the rock!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>The next day Jesus decided to go to
        Galilee. He found Philip and told him,
        <span class="jesus">"Come with me."</span>
        <span className="sup">44</span>(Philip was from Bethsaida, Andrew and
        Peter's home town.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Philip now went off to look for Nathanael
        and told him, "We have found the Messiah!--the very person Moses and the
        prophets told about! His name is Jesus, the son of Joseph from
        Nazareth!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>"Nazareth!" exclaimed Nathanael. "Can
        anything good come from there?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Just come and see for yourself," Philip declared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>As they approached, Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Here comes an honest man--a true son of Israel."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>"How do you know what I am like?"
        Nathanael demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I could see you under the fig tree before Philip found you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>Nathanael replied, "Sir, you are the Son
        of God--the King of Israel!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Jesus asked him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Do you believe all this just because I told you I had seen you under
          the fig tree? You will see greater proofs than this.
          <sup>
            <span>51</span>{' '}
          </sup>
          You will even see heaven open and the angels of God coming back and
          forth to me, the Messiah."
