      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        After dark one night a Jewish religious leader named Nicodemus, a member
        of the sect of the Pharisees, came for an interview with Jesus. "Sir,"
        he said, "we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miracles
        are proof enough of this."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "With all the earnestness I possess I tell you this: Unless you are
          born again, you can never get into the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"Born again!" exclaimed Nicodemus. "What
        do you mean? How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be
        born again?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "What I am telling you so earnestly is this: Unless one is born of
          water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.
          <span className="sup">6</span>Men can only reproduce human life, but
          the Holy Spirit gives new life from heaven;{' '}
          <span className="sup">7</span>so don't be surprised at my statement
          that you must be born again!
          <span className="sup">8</span>Just as you can hear the wind but can't
          tell where it comes from or where it will go next, so it is with the
          Spirit. We do not know on whom he will next bestow this life from
          heaven."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"What do you mean?" Nicodemus asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10,11</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You, a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don't understand these
          things? I am telling you what I know and have seen--and yet you won't
          believe me. <span className="sup">12</span>But if you don't even
          believe me when I tell you about such things as these that happen here
          among men, how can you possibly believe if I tell you what is going on
          in heaven? <span className="sup">13</span>For only I, the Messiah,
          have come to earth and will return to heaven again.
          <span className="sup">14</span>And as Moses in the wilderness lifted
          up the bronze image of a serpent on a pole, even so I must be lifted
          up upon a pole, <span className="sup">15</span>so that anyone who
          believes in me will have eternal life. <span className="sup">16</span>
          For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son so that
          anyone who believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
          <span className="sup">17</span>God did not send his Son into the world
          to condemn it, but to save it.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "There is no eternal doom awaiting those who trust him to save them.
          But those who don't trust him have already been tried and condemned
          for not believing in the only Son of God.
          <span className="sup">19</span>Their sentence is based on this fact:
          that the Light from heaven came into the world, but they loved the
          darkness more than the Light, for their deeds were evil.
          <span className="sup">20</span>They hated the heavenly Light because
          they wanted to sin in the darkness. They stayed away from that Light
          for fear their sins would be exposed and they would be punished.
          <span className="sup">21</span>But those doing right come gladly to
          the Light to let everyone see that they are doing what God wants them
          to."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Afterwards Jesus and his disciples left
        Jerusalem and stayed for a while in Judea and baptized there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23,24</span>At this time John the Baptist was not
        yet in prison. He was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was
        plenty of water there. <span className="sup">25</span>One day someone
        began an argument with John's disciples, telling them that Jesus'
        baptism was best. <span className="sup">26</span>So they came to John
        and said, "Master, the man you met on the other side of the Jordan
        River--the one you said was the Messiah--he is baptizing too, and
        everybody is going over there instead of coming here to us."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>John replied, "God in heaven appoints
        each man's work. <span className="sup">28</span>My work is to prepare
        the way for that man so that everyone will go to him. You yourselves
        know how plainly I told you that I am not the Messiah. I am here to
        prepare the way for him--that is all. <span className="sup">29</span>The
        crowds will naturally go to the main attraction--the bride will go where
        the bridegroom is! A bridegroom's friends rejoice with him. I am the
        Bridegroom's friend, and I am filled with joy at his success.
        <span className="sup">30</span>He must become greater and greater, and I
        must become less and less.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"He has come from heaven and is greater
        than anyone else. I am of the earth, and my understanding is limited to
        the things of earth. <span className="sup">32</span>He tells what he has
        seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them!
        <span className="sup">33,34</span>Those who believe him discover that
        God is a fountain of truth. For this one--sent by God--speaks God's
        words, for God's Spirit is upon him without measure or limit.
        <span className="sup">35</span>The Father loves this man because he is
        his Son, and God has given him everything there is.
        <span className="sup">36</span>And all who trust him--God's Son--to save
        them have eternal life; those who don't believe and obey him shall never
        see heaven, but the wrath of God remains upon them."
