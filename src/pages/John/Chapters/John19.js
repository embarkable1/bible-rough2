      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Pilate laid open Jesus' back with a leaded whip,
        <span className="sup">2</span>and the soldiers made a crown of thorns
        and placed it on his head and robed him in royal purple.
        <span className="sup">3</span>"Hail, 'King of the Jews!'" they mocked,
        and struck him with their fists.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>Pilate went outside again and said to the
        Jews, "I am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly
        that I find him <em>not guilty.</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of
        thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, "Behold the man!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>At sight of him the chief priests and
        Jewish officials began yelling, "Crucify! Crucify!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        " <em>You</em> crucify him," Pilate said. "I find him
        <em>not guilty.</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>They replied, "By our laws he ought to die
        because he called himself the Son of God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>When Pilate heard this, he was more
        frightened than ever. <span className="sup">9</span>He took Jesus back
        into the palace again and asked him, "Where are you from?" but Jesus
        gave no answer.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"You won't talk to me?" Pilate demanded.
        "Don't you realize that I have the power to release you or to crucify
        you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Then Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You would have no power at all over me unless it were given to you
          from above. So those who brought me to you have the greater sin."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Then Pilate tired to release him, but the
        Jewish leaders told him, "If you release this man, you are no friend of
        Caesar's. Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>At these words Pilate brought Jesus out
        to them again and sat down at the judgment bench on the stone-paved
        platform. <span className="sup">14</span>It was now about noon of the
        day before Passover.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">And Pilate said to the Jews, "Here is your king!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"Away with him," they yelled. "Away with
        him-crucify him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"What? Crucify your king?" Pilate asked.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        "We have no king but Caesar," the chief priests shouted back.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then Pilate gave Jesus to them to be
        crucified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>So they had him at last, and he was taken
        out of the city, carrying his cross to the place known as "The Skull,"
        in Hebrew, "Golgotha." <span className="sup">18</span>There they
        crucified him and two others with him, one on either side, with Jesus
        between them.
        <span className="sup">19</span>And Pilate posted a sign over him
        reading, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
        <span className="sup">20</span>The place where Jesus was crucified was
        near the city; and the signboard was written in Hebrew, Latin, and
        Greek, so that many people read it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then the chief priests said to Pilate,
        "Change it from 'The King of the Jews' to ' <em>He said,</em> I am King
        of the Jews.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Pilate replied, "What I have written, I
        have written. It stays exactly as it is."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23,24</span>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus,
        they put his garments into four piles, one for each of them. But they
        said, "Let's not tear up his robe," for it was seamless. "Let's throw
        dice to see who gets it." This fulfilled the Scripture that says,
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "They divided my clothes among them, and cast lots for my robe."
        <small>Psalm 22:18</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>So that is what they did.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Standing near the cross were Jesus' mother, Mary, his aunt, the wife of
        Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. <span className="sup">26</span>When Jesus
        saw his mother standing there beside me, his close friend, he said to
        her,
        <span class="jesus">"He is your son."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>And to me he said,
        <span class="jesus">"She is your mother!"</span> And from then on I took
        her into my home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Jesus knew that everything was now
        finished, and to fulfill the Scriptures said,
        <span class="jesus">"I'm thirsty."</span>{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so
        a sponge was soaked in it and put on a hyssop branch and held up to his
        lips.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>When Jesus had tasted it, he said,
        <span class="jesus">"It is finished," </span>and bowed his head and
        dismissed his spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>The Jewish leaders didn't want the
        victims hanging there the next day, which was the Sabbath (and a very
        special Sabbath at that, for it was the Passover), so they asked Pilate
        to order the legs of the men broken to hasten death; then their bodies
        could be taken down. <span className="sup">32</span>So the soldiers came
        and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus;
        <span className="sup">33</span>but when they came to him, they saw that
        he was dead already, so they didn't break his.
        <span className="sup">34</span>However, one of the soldiers pierced his
        side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out.
        <span className="sup">35</span>I saw all this myself and have given an
        accurate report so that you also can believe.
        <span className="sup">36,37</span>The soldiers did this in fulfillment
        of the Scripture that says, "Not one of his bones shall be broken," and,
        "They shall look on him whom they pierced.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Afterwards Joseph of Arimathea, who had
        been a secret disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jewish leaders, boldly
        asked Pilate for permission to take Jesus' body down; and Pilate told
        him to go ahead. So he came and took it away.
        <span className="sup">39</span>Nicodemus, the man who had come to Jesus
        at night, came too, bringing a hundred pounds of embalming ointment made
        from myrrh and aloes. <span className="sup">40</span>Together they
        wrapped Jesus' body in a long linen cloth saturated with the spices, as
        is the Jewish custom of burial. <span className="sup">41</span>The place
        of crucifixion was near a grove of trees, where there was a new tomb,
        never used before. <span className="sup">42</span>And so, because of the
        need for haste before the Sabbath, and because the tomb was close at
        hand, they laid him there.
