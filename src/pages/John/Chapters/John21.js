      <h3>Chapter 21</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Later Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Lake of Galilee.
        This is how it happened:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>A group of us were there--Simon Peter,
        Thomas, "The Twin," Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, my brother James and
        I and two other disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Simon Peter said, "I'm going fishing."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "We'll come too," we all said. We did, but caught nothing all night.
        <span className="sup">4</span>At dawn we saw a man standing on the beach
        but couldn't see who he was.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>He called,
        <span class="jesus">"Any fish boys?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"No," we replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Then he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you'll get
          plenty of them!"
        </span>
        So we did, and couldn't draw in the net because of the weight of the
        fish, there were so many!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Then I said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" At
        that, Simon Peter put on his tunic (for he was stripped to the waist)
        and jumped into the water [and swam ashore].
        <span className="sup">8</span>The rest of us stayed in the boat and
        pulled the loaded net to the beach, about 300 feet away.
        <span className="sup">9</span>When we got there, we saw that a fire was
        kindled and fish were frying over it, and there was bread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Bring some of the fish you've just caught," </span>
        Jesus said. <span className="sup">11</span>So Simon Peter went out and
        dragged the net ashore. By his count there were 153 large fish; and yet
        the net hadn't torn.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Now come and have some breakfast!"</span> Jesus
        said; and none of us dared ask him if he really was the Lord, for we
        were quite sure of it. <span className="sup">13</span>Then Jesus went
        around serving us the bread and fish.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>This was the third time Jesus had
        appeared to us since his return from the dead.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>After breakfast Jesus said to Simon
        Peter,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these others?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Yes," Peter replied, "You know I am your friend."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Then feed my lambs," </span>Jesus told him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Jesus repeated the question:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Simon, son of John, do you <em>really</em> love me?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Yes, Lord," Peter said, "you know I am your friend."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Then take care of my sheep,"</span> Jesus said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Once more he asked him,
        <span class="jesus">"Simon, son of John, are you even my friend?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Peter was grieved at the way Jesus asked the question this third time.
        "Lord, you know my heart; you know I am," he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Then feed my little sheep. <span className="sup">18</span>When you
          were young, you were able to do as you liked and go wherever you
          wanted to; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands and
          others will direct you and take you where you don't want to go."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus said this to let him know what kind
        of death he would die to glorify God. Then Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">"Follow me."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Peter turned around and saw the disciple
        Jesus loved following, the one who had leaned around at supper that time
        to ask Jesus, "Master, which of us will betray you?"
        <span className="sup">21</span>Peter asked Jesus, "What about him, Lord?
        What sort of death will he die?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If I want him to live until I return, what is that to you?
          <em>You</em> follow me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>So the rumor spread among the brotherhood
        that that disciple wouldn't die! But that isn't what Jesus said at all!
        He only said, "If I want him to live until I come, what is that to you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span> <em>I am that disciple!</em> I saw these
        events and have recorded them here. And we all know that my account of
        these things is accurate.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>And I suppose that if all the other
        events in Jesus' life were written, the whole world could hardly contain
        the books!
