      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Afterwards Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish religious
        holidays. <span className="sup">2</span>Inside the city, near the Sheep
        Gate, was Bethesda Pool, with five covered platforms or porches
        surrounding it. <span className="sup">3</span>Crowds of sick
        folks--lame, blind, or with paralyzed limbs--lay on the
        platforms(waiting for a certain movement of the water,{' '}
        <span className="sup">4</span>for an angel of the Lord came from time to
        time and disturbed the water, and the first person to step down into it
        afterwards was healed).
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>One of the men lying there had been sick
        for thirty-eight years. <span className="sup">6</span>When Jesus saw him
        and knew how long he had been ill, he asked him,
        <span class="jesus">"Would you like to get well?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"I can't," the sick man said, "for I have
        no one to help me into the pool at the movement of the water. While I am
        trying to get there, someone else always gets in ahead of me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Stand up, roll up your sleeping mat and go on home!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Instantly, the man was healed! He rolled
        up the mat and began walking!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        But it was on the Sabbath when this miracle was done.
        <span className="sup">10</span>So the Jewish leaders objected. They said
        to the man who was cured, "You can't work on the Sabbath! It's illegal
        to carry that sleeping mat!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"The man who healed me told me to," was
        his reply.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Who said such a thing as that?" they
        demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>The man didn't know, and Jesus had
        disappeared into the crowd. <span className="sup">14</span>But
        afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple and told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Now you are well; don't sin as you did before, or something even
          worse may happen to you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then the man went to find the Jewish
        leaders and told them it was Jesus who had healed him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>So they began harassing Jesus as a
        Sabbath breaker. <span className="sup">17</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My Father constantly does good, and I'm following his example."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Then the Jewish leaders were all the more
        eager to kill him because in addition to disobeying their Sabbath laws,
        he had spoken of God as his Father, thereby making himself equal with
        God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the
          Father doing, and in the same way. <span className="sup">20</span>For
          the Father loves the Son, and tells him everything he is doing; and
          the Son will do far more awesome miracles than this man's healing.
          <span className="sup">21</span>He will even raise from the dead anyone
          he wants to, just as the Father does. <span className="sup">22</span>
          And the Father leaves all judgment of sin to his Son,
          <span className="sup">23</span>so that everyone will honor the Son,
          just as they honor the Father. But if you refuse to honor God's Son,
          whom he sent to you, then you are certainly not honoring the Father.

        <span class="jesus">
          "I say emphatically that anyone who listens to my message and believes
          in God who sent me has eternal life, and will never be damned for his
          sins, but has already passed out of death into life.
          <span className="sup">25</span>And I solemnly declare that the time is
          coming, in fact, it is here, when the dead shall hear my voice--the
          voice of the Son of God--and those who listen shall live.
          <span className="sup">26</span>The Father has life in himself, and has
          granted his Son to have life in himself,
          <span className="sup">27</span>and to judge the sins of all mankind
          because he is the Son of Man. <span className="sup">28</span>Don't be
          so surprised! Indeed the time is coming when all the dead in their
          graves shall hear the voice of God's Son,{' '}
          <span className="sup">29</span>and shall rise again--those who have
          done good, to eternal life, and those who have continued in evil, to
          judgment.

          "But I pass no judgment without consulting the Father. I judge as I am
          told. And my judgment is absolutely fair and just, for it is according
          to the will of God who sent me and is not merely my own.

          "When I make claims about myself they aren't believed,
          <span className="sup">32,33</span> but someone else, yes, John the
          Baptist, is making these claims for me too. You have gone out to
          listen to his preaching, and I can assure you that all he says about
          me is true! <span className="sup">34</span>But the truest witness I
          have is not from a man, though I have reminded you about John's
          witness so that you will believe in me and be saved.
          <span className="sup">35</span>John shone brightly for a while, and
          you benefited and rejoiced, <span className="sup">36</span>but I have
          a greater witness than John. I refer to the miracles I do; these have
          been assigned me by the Father, and they prove that the Father has
          sent me. <span className="sup">37</span>And the Father himself has
          also testified about me, though not appearing to you personally, or
          speaking to you directly. <span className="sup">38</span>But you are
          not listening to him, for you refuse to believe me--the one sent to
          you with God's message.
