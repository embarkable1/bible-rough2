      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives, <span className="sup">2</span>but
        early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon
        gathered, and he sat down and talked to them.
        <span className="sup">3</span>As he was speaking, the Jewish leaders and
        Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery and placed her out in front
        of the staring crowd.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this woman
        was caught in the very act of adultery. <span className="sup">5</span>
        Moses' law says to kill her. What about it?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>They were trying to trap him into saying
        something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote
        in the dust with his finger. <span className="sup">7</span>They kept
        demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "All right, hurl the stones at her until she dies. But only he who
          never sinned may throw the first!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>The he stooped down again and wrote some
        more in the dust. <span className="sup">9</span>And the Jewish leaders
        slipped away one by one, beginning with the eldest, until only Jesus was
        left in front of the crowd with the woman.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>The Jesus stood up again and said to her,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"No, sir," she said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">"Neither do I. Go and sin no more."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Later, in one of his talks, Jesus said to
        the people,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am the Light of the world. So if you follow me, you won't be
          stumbling through the darkness, for living light will flood your
          path."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>The Pharisees replied, "You are
        boasting--and lying!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "These claims are true even though I make them concerning myself. For
          I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this
          about me. <span className="sup">15</span>You pass judgment on me
          without knowing the facts. I am not judging you now;
          <span className="sup">16</span>but if I were, it would be an
          absolutely correct judgment in every respect, for I have with me the
          Father who sent me. <span className="sup">17</span>Your laws say that
          if two men agree on something that has happened, their witness is
          accepted as fact. <span className="sup">18</span>Well, I am one
          witness, and my Father who sent me is the other."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Where is your father?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus answered,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You don't know who I am, so you don't know who my Father is. If you
          knew me, then you would know him too."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Jesus made these statements while in the
        section of the Temple known as the Treasury. But he was not arrested,
        for his time had not yet run out.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Later he said to them again,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am going away; and you will search for me, and die in your sins.
          And you cannot come where I am going."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>The Jews asked, "Is he planning suicide?
        What does he mean, 'You cannot come where I am going'?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then he said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are from below, I am from above. You are of this world; I am not.{' '}
          <span className="sup">24</span>That is why I said that you will die in
          your sins; for unless you believe that I am the Messiah, the Son of
          God, you will die in your sins."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Tell us who you are," they demanded.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am the one I have always claimed to be.
          <span className="sup">26</span>I could condemn you for much and teach
          you much, but I won't, for I say only what I am told to by the one who
          sent me; and he is Truth."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">27</span>But they still didn't understand that he
        was talking to them about God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>So Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When you have killed the Messiah, then you will realize that I am he
          and that I have not been telling you my own ideas, but have spoken
          what the Father taught me. <span className="sup">29</span>And he who
          sent me is with me--he has not deserted me--for I always do those
          things that are pleasing to him."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30,31</span>Then many of the Jewish leaders who
        heard him say these things began believing him to be the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are truly my disciples if you live as I tell you to,
          <span className="sup">32</span>and you will know the truth, and the
          truth will set you free."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"But we are descendants of Abraham," they
        said, "and have never been slaves to any man on earth! What do you mean,
        'set free'?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are slaves of sin, every one of you.
          <span className="sup">35</span>And slaves don't have rights, but the
          Son has every right there is! <span className="sup">36</span>So if the
          Son sets you free, you will indeed be free--
          <span className="sup">37</span>(Yes, I realize that you are
          descendants of Abraham!) And yet some of you are trying to kill me
          because my message does not find a home within your hearts.{' '}
          <span className="sup">38</span>I am telling you what I saw when I was
          with my Father. But you are following the advice of <em>your</em>{' '}
          father."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Our father is Abraham," they declared.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "No!" <span>Jesus replied, </span>"for if he were, you would follow his
        good example. <span className="sup">40</span>But instead you are trying
        to kill me--and all because I told you the truth I heard from God.
        Abraham wouldn't do a thing like that! <span className="sup">41</span>
        No, you are obeying your <em>real</em> father when you act that way."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        They replied, "We were not born out of wedlock--our true Father is God
        himself."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If that were so, then you would love me, for I have come to you from
          God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me.
          <span className="sup">43</span>Why can't you understand what I am
          saying? It is because you are prevented from doing so!
          <span className="sup">44</span>For you are the children of your father
          the devil and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a
          murderer from the beginning and a hater of truth--there is not an iota
          of truth in him. When he lies, it is perfectly normal; for he is the
          father of liars. <span className="sup">45</span>And so when I tell the
          truth, you just naturally don't believe it!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Which of you can truthfully accuse me of one single sin? [No one!]
          And since I am telling you the truth, why don't you believe me?
          <span className="sup">47</span>Anyone whose Father is God listens
          gladly to the words of God. Since you don't, it proves you aren't his
          children."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>"You Samaritan! Foreigner! Devil!" the
        Jewish leaders snarled. "Didn't we say all along you were possessed by a
        demon?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "No," <span>Jesus said, </span>"I have no demon in me. For I honor my
          Father--and you dishonor me. <span className="sup">50</span>And though
          I have no wish to make myself great, God wants this for me and judges
          [those who reject me]. <span className="sup">51</span>With all the
          earnestness I have I tell you this--no one who obeys me shall ever
          die!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>The leaders of the Jews said, "Now we
        know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the mightiest
        prophets died, and yet you say that obeying you will keep a man from
        dying!
        <span className="sup">53</span>So you are greater than our father
        Abraham, who died? And greater than the prophets, who died? Who do you
        think you are?" <span className="sup">54</span>Then Jesus told them
        this:
        <span class="jesus">
          "If I am merely boasting about myself, it doesn't count. But it is my
          Father--and you claim him as your God--who is saying these glorious
          things about me. <span className="sup">55</span>But you do not even
          know him. I do. If I said otherwise, I would be as great a liar as
          you! But it is true--I know him and fully obey him.
          <span className="sup">56</span>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my
          day. He knew I was coming and was glad."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span> <em>The Jewish leaders:</em> "You aren't
        even fifty years old--sure, you've seen Abraham!"

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">58</span> <em>Jesus:</em>
        <span class="jesus">

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>At that point the Jewish leaders picked
        up stones to kill him. But Jesus was hidden from them, and walked past
