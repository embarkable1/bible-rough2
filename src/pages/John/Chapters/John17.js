      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When Jesus had finished saying all these things he looked up to heaven
        and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Father, the time has come. Reveal the glory of your Son so that he
          can give the glory back to you. <span className="sup">2</span>For you
          have given him authority over every man and woman in all the earth. He
          gives eternal life to each one you have given him.
          <span className="sup">3</span>And this is the way to have eternal
          life--by knowing you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, the one you
          sent to earth! <span className="sup">4</span>I brought glory to you
          here on earth by doing everything you told me to.{' '}
          <span className="sup">5</span>And now, Father, reveal my glory as I
          stand in your presence, the glory we shared before the world began.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"I have told these men all about you. They
        were in the world, but then you gave them to me. Actually, they were
        always yours, and you gave them to me; and they have obeyed you.
        <span className="sup">7</span>Now they know that everything I have is a
        gift from you, <span className="sup">8</span>for I have passed on to
        them the commands you gave me; and they accepted them and know of a
        certainty that I came down to earth from you, and they believe you sent
        me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"My plea is not for the world but for
        those you have given me because they belong to you.
        <span className="sup">10</span>And all of them, since they are mine,
        belong to you; and you have given them back to me with everything else
        of yours, and so <em>they are my glory!</em>{' '}
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now I am leaving the world, and leaving
        them behind, and coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your own
        care--all those you have given me--so that they will be united just as
        we are, with none missing.
        <span className="sup">12</span>During my time here I have kept safe
        within your family all of these you gave me. I guarded them so that not
        one perished, except the son of hell, as the Scriptures foretold.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"And now I am coming to you. I have told
        them many things while I was with them so that they would be filled with
        my joy. <span className="sup">14</span>I have given them your commands.
        And the world hates them because they don't fit in with it, just as I
        don't.
        <span className="sup">15</span>I'm not asking you to take them out of
        the world, but to keep them safe from Satan's power.
        <span className="sup">16</span>They are not part of this world any more
        than I am. <span className="sup">17</span>Make them pure and holy
        through teaching them your words of truth.{' '}
        <span className="sup">18</span>As you sent me into the world, I am
        sending them into the world,
        <span className="sup">19</span>and I consecrate myself to meet their
        need for growth in truth and holiness.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"I am not praying for these alone but
        also for the future believers who will come to me because of the
        testimony of these. <span className="sup">21</span>My prayer for all of
        them is that they will be of one heart and mind, just as you and I are,
        Father--that just as you are in me and I am in you, so they will be in
        us, and the world will believe you sent me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"I have given them the glory you gave
        me--the glorious unity of being one, as we are--{' '}
        <span className="sup">23</span>I in them and you in me, all being
        perfected into one--so that the world will know you sent me and will
        understand that you love them as much as you love me.{' '}
        <span className="sup">24</span>Father, I want them with me--these you've
        given me--so that they can see my glory. You gave me the glory because
        you loved me before the world began!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"O righteous Father, the world doesn't
        know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me.
        <span className="sup">26</span>And I have revealed you to them, and will
        keep on revealing you so that the mighty love you have for me may be in
        them, and I in them."
