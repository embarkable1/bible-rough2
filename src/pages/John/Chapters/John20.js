      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Early Sunday morning, while it was sill dark, Mary Magdalene came to the
        tomb and found that the stone was rolled aside from the entrance.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>She ran and found Simon Peter and me and
        said, "They have taken the Lord's body out of the tomb, and I don't know
        where they have put him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3,4</span>We ran to the tomb to see; I outran
        Peter and got there first, <span className="sup">5</span>and stooped and
        looked in and saw the linen cloth lying there, but I didn't go in.
        <span className="sup">6</span>Then Simon Peter arrived and went on
        inside. He also noticed the cloth lying there,{' '}
        <span className="sup">7</span>while the swath that had covered Jesus'
        head was rolled up in a bundle and was lying at the side.{' '}
        <span className="sup">8</span>Then I went in too, and saw, and believed
        [that he had risen]-- <span className="sup">9</span>for until then we
        hadn't realized that the Scriptures said he would come to life again!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>We went on home,
        <span className="sup">11</span>and by that time Mary had returned to the
        tomb and was standing outside crying. And as she wept, she stooped and
        looked in <span className="sup">12</span>and saw two white-robed angels
        sitting at the head and foot of the place where the body of Jesus had
        been lying.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"Why are you crying?" the angels asked
        her.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know
        where they have put him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>She glanced over her shoulder and saw
        someone standing behind her. It was Jesus, but she didn't recognize him!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why are you crying?" <span>he asked her. </span>"Whom are you looking
          for?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        She thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she said, "if you have taken him
        away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span> <span class="jesus">"Mary!"</span> Jesus
        said. She turned toward him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Master!" she exclaimed.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't touch me," <span>he cautioned, </span>"for I haven't yet
          ascended to the Father. But go find my brothers and tell them that I
          ascend to my Father and your Father, my God and your God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Mary Magdalene found the disciples and
        told them, "I have seen the Lord!" Then she gave them his message.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>That evening the disciples were meeting
        behind locked doors, in fear of the Jewish leaders, when suddenly Jesus
        was standing there among them! After greeting them,
        <span className="sup">20</span>he showed them his hands and side. And
        how wonderful was their joy as they saw their Lord!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>He spoke to them again and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "As the Father has sent me, even so I am sending you."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">22</span>Then he breathed on them and told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Receive the Holy Spirit. <span className="sup">23</span>If you
          forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you refuse to forgive
          them, they are unforgiven."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>One of the disciples, Thomas, "The Twin,"
        was not there at the time with the others.{' '}
        <span className="sup">25</span>When they kept telling him, "We have seen
        the Lord," he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds
        in his hands--and put my fingers into them--and place my hand into his
        side."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Eight days later the disciples were
        together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were
        locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them and
        greeting them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Then he said to Thomas,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Put your finger into my hands. Put your hand into my side. Don't be
          faithless any longer. Believe!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"My Lord and my God!" Thomas said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Then Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You believe because you have seen me. But blessed are those who
          haven't seen me and believe anyway."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30,31</span>Jesus' disciples saw him do many other
        miracles besides the ones told about in this book, but these are
        recorded so that you will believe that he is the Messiah, the Son of
        God, and that believing in him you will have life.
