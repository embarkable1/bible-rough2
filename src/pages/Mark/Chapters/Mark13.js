      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        As he was leaving the Temple that day, one of his disciples said,
        "Teacher, what beautiful buildings these are! Look at the decorated
        stonework on the walls."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes, look! For not one stone will be left upon another, except as
          ruins."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3,4</span>And as he sat on the slopes of the Mount
        of Olives across the valley from Jerusalem, Peter, James, John, and
        Andrew got alone with him and asked him, "Just when is all this going to
        happen to the Temple? Will there be some warning ahead of time?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>So Jesus launched into an extended reply.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't let anyone mislead you,"
          <span>
            he said, <span className="sup">6</span>{' '}
          </span>
          "for many will come declaring themselves to be your Messiah, and will
          lead many astray.
          <span className="sup">7</span>And wars will break out near and far,
          but this is not the signal of the end-time.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"For nations and kingdoms will proclaim
        war against each other, and there will be earthquakes in many lands, and
        famines. These herald only the early stages of the anguish ahead.
        <span className="sup">9</span>But when these things begin to happen,
        watch out! For you will be in great danger. You will be dragged before
        the courts, and beaten in the synagogues, and accused before governors
        and kings of being my followers. This is your opportunity to tell them
        the Good News. <span className="sup">10</span>And the Good News must
        first be made known in every nation before the end-time finally comes.
        <span className="sup">11</span>But when you are arrested and stand
        trial, don't worry about what to say in your defense. Just say what God
        tells you to. Then you will not be speaking, but the Holy Spirit will.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Brothers will betray each other to
        death, fathers will betray their own children, and children will betray
        their parents to be killed. <span className="sup">13</span>And everyone
        will hate you because you are mine. But all who endure to the end
        without renouncing me shall be saved.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"When you see the horrible thing standing
        in the Temple--reader, pay attention!--flee, if you can, to the Judean
        hills. <span className="sup">15,16</span>Hurry! If you are on your
        rooftop porch, don't even go back into the house. If you are out in the
        fields, don't even return for your money or clothes.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"Woe to pregnant women in those days, and
        to mothers nursing their children. <span className="sup">18</span>And
        pray that your flight will not be in winter.{' '}
        <span className="sup">19</span>For those will be days of such horror as
        have never been since the beginning of God's creation, nor will ever be
        again. <span className="sup">20</span>And unless the Lord shortens that
        time of calamity, not a soul in all the earth will survive. But for the
        sake of his chosen ones he will limit those days.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"And then if anyone tells you, 'This is
        the Messiah,' or, 'That one is,' don't pay any attention.
        <span className="sup">22</span>For there will be many false Messiahs and
        false prophets who will do wonderful miracles that would deceive, if
        possible, even God's own children. <span className="sup">23</span>Take
        care! I have warned you!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"After the tribulation ends, then the sun
        will grow dim and the moon will not shine,
        <span className="sup">25</span>and the stars will fall--the heavens will
        convulse.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"Then all mankind will see me, the
        Messiah, coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
        <span className="sup">27</span>And I will send out the angels to gather
        together my chosen ones from all over the world--from the farthest
        bounds of earth and heaven.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"Now, here is a lesson from a fig tree.
        When its buds become tender and its leaves begin to sprout, you know
        that spring has come. <span className="sup">29</span>And when you see
        these things happening that I've described, you can be sure that my
        return is very near, that I am right at the door.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"Yes, these are the events that will
        signal the end of the age. <span className="sup">31</span>Heaven and
        earth shall disappear, but my words stand sure forever.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"However, no one, not even the angels in
        heaven, nor I myself, knows the day or hour when these things will
        happen; only the Father knows. <span className="sup">33</span>And since
        you don't know when it will happen, stay alert. Be on the watch [for my
        return].
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"My coming can be compared with that of a
        man who went on a trip to another country. He laid out his employees'
        work for them to do while he was gone, and told the gatekeeper to watch
        for his return.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">35,36,37</span>"Keep a sharp lookout! For you do
        not know when I will come, at evening, at midnight, early dawn or late
        daybreak. Don't let me find you sleeping.
        <em>Watch for my return!</em> This is my message to you and everyone
        else."
