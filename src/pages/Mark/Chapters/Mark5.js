      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When they arrived at the other side of the lake a demon-possessed man
        ran out from a graveyard, just as Jesus was climbing from the boat.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3,4</span>This man lived among the gravestones,
        and had such strength that whenever he was put into handcuffs and
        shackles--as he often was--he snapped the handcuffs from his wrists and
        smashed the shackles and walked away. No one was strong enough to
        control him. <span className="sup">5</span>All day long and through the
        night he would wander among the tombs and in the wild hills, screaming
        and cutting himself with sharp pieces of stone.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>When Jesus was still far out on the water,
        the man had seen him and had run to meet him, and fell down before him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7,8</span>Then Jesus spoke to the demon within the
        man and said, <span class="jesus">"Come out, you evil spirit."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        It gave a terrible scream, shrieking, "What are you going to do to me,
        Jesus, Son of the Most High God? For God's sake, don't torture me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What is your name?"</span> Jesus asked, and the
        demon replied, "Legion, for there are many of us here within this man."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then the demons begged him again and
        again not to send them to some distant land.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now as it happened there was a huge herd
        of hogs rooting around on the hill above the lake.
        <span className="sup">12</span>"Send us into those hogs," the demons
        begged.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>And Jesus gave them permission. Then the
        evil spirits came out of the man and entered the hogs, and the entire
        herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>The herdsmen fled to the nearby towns and
        countryside, spreading the news as they ran. Everyone rushed out to see
        for themselves. <span className="sup">15</span>And a large crowd soon
        gathered where Jesus was; but as they saw the man sitting there, fully
        clothed and perfectly sane, they were frightened.
        <span className="sup">16</span>Those who saw what happened were telling
        everyone about it, <span className="sup">17</span>and the crowd began
        pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone!
        <span className="sup">18</span>So he got back into the boat. The man who
        had been possessed by the demons begged Jesus to let him go along.
        <span className="sup">19</span>But Jesus said no.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Go home to your friends," <span>he told him, </span>"and tell them what
        wonderful things God has done for you; and how merciful he has been."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>So the man started off to visit the Ten
        Towns of that region and began to tell everyone about the great things
        Jesus had done for him; and they were awestruck by his story.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>When Jesus had gone across by boat to the
        other side of the lake, a vast crowd gathered around him on the shore.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>The leader of the local synagogue, whose
        name was Jairus, came and fell down before him,
        <span className="sup">23</span>pleading with him to heal his little
        daughter.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "She is at the point of death," he said in desperation. "Please come and
        place your hands on her and make her live."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Jesus went with him, and the crowd
        thronged behind. <span className="sup">25</span>In the crowd was a woman
        who had been sick for twelve years with a hemorrhage.{' '}
        <span className="sup">26</span>She had suffered much from many doctors
        through the years and had become poor from paying them, and was no
        better but, in fact, was worse.
        <span className="sup">27</span>She had heard all about the wonderful
        miracles Jesus did, and that is why she came up behind him through the
        crowd and touched his clothes.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>For she thought to herself, "If I can
        just touch his clothing, I will be healed."{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>And sure enough, as soon as she had
        touched him, the bleeding stopped and she knew she was well!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Jesus realized at once that healing power
        had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked,
        <span class="jesus">"Who touched my clothes?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>His disciples said to him, "All this
        crowd pressing around you, and you ask who touched you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>But he kept on looking around to see who
        it was who had done it. <span className="sup">33</span>Then the
        frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to
        her, came and fell at his feet and told him what she had done.
        <span className="sup">34</span>And he said to her,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Daughter, your faith has made you well, go in peace, healed of your
          disease."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>While he was still talking to her,
        messengers arrived from Jairus' home with the news that it was too
        late--his daughter was dead and there was no point in Jesus' coming now.
        <span className="sup">36</span>But Jesus ignored their comments and said
        to Jairus, <span class="jesus">"Don't be afraid. Just trust me."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Then Jesus halted the crowd and wouldn't
        let anyone go on with him to Jairus' home except Peter and James and
        John.
        <span className="sup">38</span>When they arrived, Jesus saw that all was
        in great confusion, with unrestrained weeping and wailing.
        <span className="sup">39</span>He went inside and spoke to the people.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Why all this weeping and commotion?" <span>he asked. </span>"The child
        isn't dead; she is only asleep!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>They laughed at him in bitter derision,
        but he told them all to leave, and taking the little girl's father and
        mother and his three disciples, he went into the room where she was
        lying.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41,42</span>Taking her by the hand he said to her,
        <span class="jesus">"Get up, little girl!" </span>(She was twelve years
        old.) And she jumped up and walked around! Her parents just couldn't get
        over it. <span className="sup">43</span>Jesus instructed them very
        earnestly not to tell what had happened, and told them to give her
        something to eat.
