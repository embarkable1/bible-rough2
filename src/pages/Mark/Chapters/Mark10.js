      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then he left Capernaum and went southward to the Judean borders and into
        the area east of the Jordan River. And as always there were the crowds;
        and as usual he taught them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Some Pharisees came and asked him, "Do you
        permit divorce?" Of course they were trying to trap him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What did Moses say about divorce?" </span>Jesus
        asked them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"He said it was all right," they replied.
        "He said that all a man has to do is write his wife a letter of
        dismissal."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"And why did he say that?"
        <span>Jesus asked. </span>"I'll tell you why--it was a concession to
        your hard-hearted wickedness. <span className="sup">6,7</span>But it
        certainly isn't God's way. For from the very first he made man and woman
        to be joined together permanently in marriage; therefore a man is to
        leave his father and mother, <span className="sup">8</span>and he and
        his wife are united so that they are no longer two, but one.
        <span className="sup">9</span>And no man may separate what God has
        joined together.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Later, when he was alone with his
        disciples in the house, they brought up the subject again.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>He told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When a man divorces his wife to marry someone else, he commits
          adultery against her. <span className="sup">12</span>And if a wife
          divorces her husband and remarries, she, too, commits adultery."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Once when some mothers were bringing
        their children to Jesus to bless them, the disciples shooed them away,
        telling them not to bother him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>But when Jesus saw what was happening he
        was very much displeased with his disciples and said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let the children come to me, for the Kingdom of God belongs to such
          as they. Don't send them away! <span className="sup">15</span>I tell
          you as seriously as I know how that anyone who refuses to come to God
          as a little child will never be allowed into his Kingdom."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then he took the children into his arms
        and placed his hands on their heads and he blessed them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>As he was starting out on a trip, a man
        came running to him and knelt down and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I
        do to get to heaven?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why do you call me good?" <span>Jesus asked. </span>"Only God is
          truly good! <span className="sup">19</span>But as for your
          question--you know the commandments: don't kill, don't commit
          adultery, don't steal, don't lie, don't cheat, respect your father and
          mother."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"Teacher," the man replied, "I've never
        once broken a single one of those laws."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Jesus felt genuine love for this man as
        he looked at him.
        <span class="jesus">
          "You lack only one thing," <span>he told him; </span>"go and sell all
          you have and give the money to the poor--and you shall have treasure
          in heaven--and come, follow me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Then the man's face fell, and he went
        sadly away, for he was very rich.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus watched him go, then turned around
        and said to his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It's almost impossible for the rich to get into the Kingdom of God!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>This amazed them. So Jesus said it again:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Dear children, how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter
          the Kingdom of God. <span className="sup">25</span>It is easier for a
          camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter
          the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>The disciples were incredulous! "Then who
        in the world can be saved, if not a rich man?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Jesus looked at them intently, then said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Without God, it is utterly impossible. But with God everything is
          possible."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Then Peter began to mention all that he
        and the other disciples had left behind. "We've given up everything to
        follow you," he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let me assure you that no one has ever given up anything--home,
          brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or property--for love of
          me and to tell others the Good News, <span className="sup">30</span>
          who won't be given back, a hundred times over, homes, brothers,
          sisters, mothers, children, and land--with persecutions!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "All these will be his here on earth, and in the world to come he shall
        have eternal life. <span className="sup">31</span>But many people who
        seem to be important now will be the least important then; and many who
        are considered least here shall be greatest there."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Now they were on the way to Jerusalem,
        and Jesus was walking along ahead; and as the disciples were following
        they were filled with terror and dread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Taking them aside, Jesus once more began describing all that was going
        to happen to him when they arrived at Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"When we get there,"
        <span>he told them, </span>"I, the Messiah, will be arrested and taken
        before the chief priests and the Jewish leaders, who will sentence me to
        die and hand me over to the Romans to be killed.
        <span className="sup">34</span>They will mock me and spit on me and flog
        me with their whips and kill me; but after three days I will come back
        to life again."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee,
        came over and spoke to him in a low voice. "Master," they said, "we want
        you to do us a favor."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span> <span class="jesus">"What is it?"</span>{' '}
        he asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"We want to sit on the thrones next to
        yours in your kingdom," they said, "one at your right and the other at
        your left!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>But Jesus answered,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the
          bitter cup of sorrow I must drink from? Or to be baptized with the
          baptism of suffering I must be baptized with?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Oh, yes," they said, "we are!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You shall indeed drink from my cup and be baptized with my baptism,
          <span className="sup">40</span>but I do not have the right to place
          you on thrones next to mine. Those appointments have already been
          made."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>When the other disciples discovered what
        James and John had asked, they were very indignant.
        <span className="sup">42</span>So Jesus called them to him and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "As you know, the kings and great men of the earth lord it over the
          people; <span className="sup">43</span>but among you it is different.
          Whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant.
          <span className="sup">44</span>And whoever wants to be greatest of all
          must be the slave of all. <span className="sup">45</span>For even I,
          the Messiah, am not here to be served, but to help others, and to give
          my life as a ransom for many."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>And so they reached Jericho. Later, as
        they left town, a great crowd was following. Now it happened that a
        blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting beside
        the road as Jesus was going by.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus from
        Nazareth was near, he began to shout out, "Jesus, Son of David, have
        mercy on me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>"Shut up!" some of the people yelled at
        him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        But he only shouted the louder, again and again, "O Son of David, have
        mercy on me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>When Jesus heard him he stopped there in
        the road and said, <span class="jesus">"Tell him to come here."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        So they called the blind man. "You lucky fellow," they said, "come on,
        he's calling you!" <span className="sup">50</span>Bartimaeus yanked off
        his old coat and flung it aside, jumped up and came to Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What do you want me to do for you?"</span> Jesus
        asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"O Teacher," the blind man said, "I want to see!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>And Jesus said to him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "All right, it's done. Your faith has healed you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And instantly the blind man could see, and followed Jesus down the road!
