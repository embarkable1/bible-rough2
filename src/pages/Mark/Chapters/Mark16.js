      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        The next evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene and Salome and
        Mary the mother of James went out and purchased embalming spices.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Early the following morning, just at sunrise, they carried them out to
        the tomb. <span className="sup">3</span>On the way they were discussing
        how they could ever roll aside the huge stone from the entrance.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>But when they arrived they looked up and
        saw that the stone--a <em>very</em> heavy one--was already moved away
        and the entrance was open! <span className="sup">5</span>So they entered
        the tomb--and there on the right sat a young man clothed in white. The
        women were startled, <span className="sup">6</span>but the angel said,
        "Don't be so surprised. Aren't you looking for Jesus, the Nazarene who
        was crucified? He isn't here! He has come back to life! Look, that's
        where his body was lying. <span className="sup">7</span>Now go and give
        this message to his disciples including Peter:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "'Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just
        as he told you before he died!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>The women fled from the tomb, trembling
        and bewildered, too frightened to talk.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>It was early on Sunday morning when Jesus
        came back to life, and the first person who saw him was Mary
        Magdalene--the woman from who he had cast out seven demons.
        <span className="sup">10,11</span>She found the disciples wet-eyed with
        grief and exclaimed that she had seen Jesus, and he was alive! But they
        didn't believe her!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Later that day he appeared to two who
        were walking from Jerusalem into the country, but they didn't recognize
        him at first because he had changed his appearance.
        <span className="sup">13</span>When they finally realized who he was,
        they rushed back to Jerusalem to tell the others, but no one believed
        them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Still later he appeared to the eleven
        disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their
        unbelief--their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him alive
        from the dead.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>And then he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are to go into all the world and preach the Good News to
          everyone, everywhere. <span className="sup">16</span>Those who believe
          and are baptized will be saved. But those who refuse to believe will
          be condemned.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"And those who believe shall use my
        authority to cast out demons, and they shall speak new languages.
        <span className="sup">18</span>They will be able even to handle snakes
        with safety, and if they drink anything poisonous, it won't hurt them;
        and they will be able to place their hands on the sick and heal them."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>When the Lord Jesus had finished talking
        with them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at God's right hand.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>And the disciples went everywhere
        preaching, and the Lord was with them and confirmed what they said by
        the miracles that followed their messages.
      </p>
