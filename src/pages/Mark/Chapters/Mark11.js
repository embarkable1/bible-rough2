      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        As they neared Bethphage and Bethany on the outskirts of Jerusalem and
        came to the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Go into the village over there,"
        <span>he told them, </span>"and just as you enter you will see a colt
        tied up that has never been ridden. Untie him and bring him here.
        <span className="sup">3</span>And if anyone asks you what you are doing,
        just say, 'Our Master needs him and will return him soon.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4,5</span>Off went the two men and found the colt
        standing in the street, tied outside a house. As they were untying it,
        some who were standing there demanded, "What are you doing, untying that
        colt?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>So they said what Jesus had told them to,
        and then the men agreed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>So the colt was brought to Jesus and the
        disciples threw their cloaks across its back for him to ride on.
        <span className="sup">8</span>Then many in the crowd spread out their
        coats along the road before him, while others threw down leafy branches
        from the fields.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>He was in the center of the procession
        with crowds ahead and behind, and all of them shouting, "Hail to the
        King!" "Praise God for him who comes in the name of the Lord!" . . .
        <span className="sup">10</span>"Praise God for the return of our father
        David's kingdom . . ." "Hail to the King of the universe!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And so he entered Jerusalem and went into
        the Temple. He looked around carefully at everything and then left--for
        now it was late in the afternoon--and went out to Bethany with the
        twelve disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>The next morning as they left Bethany, he
        felt hungry. <span className="sup">13</span>A little way off he noticed
        a fig tree in full leaf, so he went over to see if he could find any
        figs on it. But no, there were only leaves, for it was too early in the
        season for fruit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then Jesus said to the tree,
        <span class="jesus">"You shall never bear fruit again!"</span> And the
        disciples heard him say it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>When they arrived back to Jerusalem he
        went to the Temple and began to drive out the merchants and their
        customers, and knocked over the tables of the moneychangers and the
        stalls of those selling doves, <span className="sup">16</span>and
        stopped everyone from bringing in loads of merchandise.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>He told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is written in the Scriptures, 'My Temple is to be a place of
          prayer for all nations,' but you have turned it into a den of
          robbers."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>When the chief priests and other Jewish
        leaders heard what he had done they began planning how best to get rid
        of him. Their problem was their fear of riots because the people were so
        enthusiastic about Jesus' teaching.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>That evening as usual they left the city.
        <span className="sup">20</span>Next morning, as the disciples passed the
        fig tree he had cursed, they saw that it was withered from the roots!
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said
        to the tree on the previous day, and exclaimed, "Look, Teacher! The fig
        tree you cursed has withered!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>In reply Jesus said to the disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you only have faith in God--this is the absolute truth--you can
          say to this Mount of Olives, 'Rise up and fall into the
          Mediterranean,' and your command will be obeyed. All that's required
          is that you really believe and have no doubt!
          <span className="sup">24</span>Listen to me! You can pray for
          <em>anything,</em> and <em>if you believe, you have it;</em> it's
          yours! <span className="sup">25</span>But when you are praying, first
          forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father
          in heaven will forgive you your sins too."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26,27,28</span>By this time they had arrived in
        Jerusalem again, and as he was walking through the Temple area, the
        chief priests and other Jewish leaders came up to him demanding, "What's
        going on here? Who gave you the authority to drive out the merchants?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I'll tell you if you answer one question!
          <span className="sup">30</span>What about John the Baptist? Was he
          sent by God, or not? Answer me!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>They talked it over among themselves. "If
        we reply that God sent him, then he will say, 'All right, why didn't you
        accept him?' <span className="sup">32</span>But if we say God didn't
        send him, then the people will start a riot." (For the people all
        believed strongly that John was a prophet.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>So they said, "We can't answer. We don't
        know."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        To which Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">"Then I won't answer your question either!"</span>
