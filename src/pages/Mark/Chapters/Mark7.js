      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day some Jewish religious leaders arrived from Jerusalem to
        investigate him, <span className="sup">2</span>and noticed that some of
        his disciples failed to follow the usual Jewish rituals before eating,
        <span className="sup">3</span>(For the Jews, especially the Pharisees,
        will never eat until they have sprinkled their arms to the elbows, as
        required by their ancient traditions. <span className="sup">4</span>So
        when they come home from the market they must always sprinkle themselves
        in this way before touching the food. This is but one of many examples
        of laws and regulations they have clung to for centuries, and still
        follow, such as their ceremony of cleansing for pots, pans and dishes.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>So the religious leaders asked him, "Why
        don't your disciples follow our age-old customs? For they eat without
        first performing the washing ceremony."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">6,7</span>Jesus replied,{' '}
        </span>
        "You bunch of hypocrites! Isaiah the prophet described you very well
        when he said, 'These people speak very prettily about the Lord but they
        have no love for him at all. Their worship is a farce, for they claim
        that God commands the people to obey their petty rules.' How right
        Isaiah was!
        <span className="sup">8</span>For you ignore God's specific orders and
        substitute your own traditions. <span className="sup">9</span>You are
        simply rejecting God's laws and trampling them under your feet for the
        sake of tradition.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>For instance, Moses gave you this law
        from God; 'Honor your father and mother.' And he said that anyone who
        speaks against his father or mother must die.{' '}
        <span className="sup">11</span>But you say it is perfectly all right for
        a man to disregard his needy parents, telling them, 'Sorry, I can't help
        you! For I have given to God what I could have given to you.'{' '}
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>And so you break the law of God in
        order to protect your man-made tradition. And this is only one example.
        There are many, many others."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then Jesus called to the crowd to come
        and hear.
        <span class="jesus">
          "All of you listen," <span>he said, </span>"and try to understand.
          <span className="sup">15,16</span>Your souls aren't harmed by what you
          eat, but by what you think and say!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Then he went into a house to get away
        from the crowds, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the
        statement he had just made.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't you understand either?" <span>he asked. </span>"Can't you see
          that what you eat won't harm your soul?{' '}
          <span className="sup">19</span>For food doesn't come in contact with
          your heart, but only passes through the digestive system."
        </span>
        (By saying this he showed that every kind of food is kosher.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>And then he added,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is the thought-life that pollutes. <span className="sup">21</span>
          For from within, out of men's hearts, come evil thoughts of lust,
          theft, murder, adultery, <span className="sup">22</span>wanting what
          belongs to others, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, pride,
          and all other folly. <span className="sup">23</span>All these vile
          things come from within; they are what pollute you and make you unfit
          for God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Then he left Galilee and went to the
        region of Tyre and Sidon, and tried to keep it a secret that he was
        there, but couldn't. For as usual the news of his arrival spread fast.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Right away a woman came to him whose
        little girl was possessed by a demon. She had heard about Jesus and now
        she came and fell at his feet, <span className="sup">26</span>and pled
        with him to release her child from the demon's control. (But she was
        Syrophoenician--a "despised Gentile!")
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Jesus told her,
        <span class="jesus">
          "First I should help my own family--the Jews. It isn't right to take
          the children's food and throw it to the dogs."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>She replied, "That's true, sir, but even
        the puppies under the table are given some scraps from the children's
        plates."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Good!" <span>he said, </span>"You have answered well--so well that I
          have healed your little girl. Go on home, for the demon has left her!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>And when she arrived home, her little
        girl was lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>From Tyre he went to Sidon, then back to
        the Sea of Galilee by way of the Ten Towns.{' '}
        <span className="sup">32</span>A deaf man with a speech impediment was
        brought to him, and everyone begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man
        and heal him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Jesus led him away from the crowd and put
        his fingers into the man's ears, then spat and touched the man's tongue
        with the spittle. <span className="sup">34</span>Then looking up to
        heaven, he sighed and commanded, <span class="jesus">"Open!"</span>
        <span className="sup">35</span>Instantly the man could hear perfectly
        and speak plainly!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Jesus told the crowd not to spread the
        news, but the more he forbade them, the more they made it known,
        <span className="sup">37</span>for they were overcome with utter
        amazement. Again and again they said, "Everything he does is wonderful;
        he even corrects deafness and stammering!"
