      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Once again an immense crowd gathered around him on the beach as he was
        teaching, so he got into a boat and sat down and talked from there.
        <span className="sup">2</span>His usual method of teaching was to tell
        the people stories. One of them went like this:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"Listen! A farmer decided to sow some
        grain. As he scattered it across his field,{' '}
        <span className="sup">4</span>some of it fell on a path, and the birds
        came and picked it off the hard ground and ate it.{' '}
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>Some fell on thin soil with underlying
        rock. It grew up quickly enough, but soon wilted beneath the hot sun and
        died because the roots had no nourishment in the shallow soil.{' '}
        <span className="sup">7</span>Other seeds fell among thorns that shot up
        and crowded the young plants so that they produced no grain.
        <span className="sup">8</span>But some of the seeds fell into good soil
        and yielded thirty times as much as he had planted--some of it even
        sixty or a hundred times as much! <span className="sup">9</span>If you
        have ears, listen!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Afterwards, when he was alone with the
        Twelve and with his other disciples, they asked him, "What does your
        story mean?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11,12</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are permitted to know some truths about the Kingdom of God that
          are hidden to those outside the Kingdom:
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        'Though they see and hear, they will not understand or turn to God, or
        be forgiven for their sins.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>But if you can't understand
        <em>this</em> simple illustration, what will you do about all the others
        I am going to tell?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"The farmer I talked about is anyone who
        brings God's message to others, trying to plant good seed within their
        lives. <span className="sup">15</span>The hard pathway, where some of
        the seed fell, represents the hard hearts of some of those who hear
        God's message; Satan comes at once to try to make them forget it.
        <span className="sup">16</span>The rocky soil represents the hearts of
        those who hear the message with joy, <span className="sup">17</span>but,
        like young plants in such soil, their roots don't go very deep, and
        though at first they get along fine, as soon as persecution begins, they
        wilt.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"The thorny ground represents the hearts
        of people who listen to the Good News and receive it,
        <span className="sup">19</span>but all too quickly the attractions of
        this world and the delights of wealth, and the search for success and
        lure of nice things come in and crowd out God's message from their
        hearts, so that no crop is produced.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But the good soil represents the hearts
        of those who truly accept God's message and produce a plentiful harvest
        for God--thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as was planted
        in their hearts. <span className="sup">21</span>Then he asked them,
        "When someone lights a lamp, does he put a box over it to shut out the
        light? Of course not! The light couldn't be seen or used. A lamp is
        placed on a stand to shine and be useful.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"All that is now hidden will someday come
        to light. <span className="sup">23</span>If you have ears, listen!
        <span className="sup">24</span>And be sure to put into practice what you
        hear. The more you do this, the more you will understand what I tell
        you. <span className="sup">25</span>To him who has shall be given; from
        him who has not shall be taken away even what he has.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"Here is another story illustrating what
        the Kingdom of God is like:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "A farmer sowed his field, <span className="sup">27</span>and went away,
        and as the days went by, the seeds grew and grew without his help.
        <span className="sup">28</span>For the soil made the seeds grow. First a
        leaf-blade pushed through, and later the wheat-heads formed and finally
        the grain ripened, <span className="sup">29</span>and then the farmer
        came at once with his sickle and harvested it."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">30</span>Jesus asked,{' '}
        </span>
        "How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story shall I use to
        illustrate it?
        <span className="sup">31,32</span>It is like a tiny mustard seed! Though
        this is one of the smallest of seeds, yet it grows to become one of the
        largest of plants, with long branches where birds can build their nests
        and be sheltered."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>He used many such illustrations to teach
        the people as much as they were ready to understand.
        <span className="sup">34</span>In fact, he taught only by illustrations
        in his public teaching, but afterwards, when he was alone with his
        disciples, he would explain his meaning to them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>As evening fell, Jesus said to his
        disciples,
        <span class="jesus">"Let's cross to the other side of the lake."</span>
        <span className="sup">36</span>So they took him just as he was and
        started out, leaving the crowds behind (though other boats followed).
        <span className="sup">37</span>But soon a terrible storm arose. High
        waves began to break into the boat until it was nearly full of water and
        about to sink. <span className="sup">38</span>Jesus was asleep at the
        back of the boat with his head on a cushion. Frantically they wakened
        him, shouting, "Teacher, don't you even care that we are all about to
        drown?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Then he rebuked the wind and said to the
        sea,
        <span class="jesus">"Quiet down!"</span> And the wind fell, and there
        was a great calm!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>And he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why were you so fearful? Don't you even yet have confidence in me?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>And they were filled with awe and said
        among themselves, "Who is this man, that even the winds and seas obey
        him?"
      </p>
