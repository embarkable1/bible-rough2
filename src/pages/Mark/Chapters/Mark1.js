      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Here begins the wonderful story of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>In the book written by the prophet Isaiah,
        God announced that he would send his Son to earth, and that a special
        messenger would arrive first to prepare the world for his coming.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"This messenger will live out in the
        barren wilderness," Isaiah said, "and will proclaim that everyone must
        straighten out his life to be ready for the Lord's arrival."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>This messenger was John the Baptist. He
        lived in the wilderness and taught that all should be baptized as a
        public announcement of their decision to turn their backs on sin, so
        that God could forgive them. <span className="sup">5</span>People from
        Jerusalem and from all over Judea traveled out into the Judean
        wastelands to see and hear John, and when they confessed their sins he
        baptized them in the Jordan River. <span className="sup">6</span>His
        clothes were woven from camel's hair and he wore a leather belt; locusts
        and wild honey were his food. <span className="sup">7</span>Here is a
        sample of his preaching:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Someone is coming soon who is far greater than I am, so much greater
        that I am not even worthy to be his slave.{' '}
        <span className="sup">8</span>I baptize you with water but he will
        baptize you with God's Holy Spirit!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then one day Jesus came from Nazareth in
        Galilee, and was baptized by John there in the Jordan River.
        <span className="sup">10</span>The moment Jesus came up out of the
        water, he saw the heavens open and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove
        descending on him, <span className="sup">11</span>and voice from heaven
        said, "You are my beloved Son; you are my Delight."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12,13</span>Immediately the Holy Spirit urged
        Jesus into the desert. There, for forty days, alone except for desert
        animals, he was subjected to Satan's temptations to sin. And afterwards
        the angels came and cared for him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Later on, after John was arrested by King
        Herod, Jesus went to Galilee to preach God's Good News.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"At last the time has come!"
        <span>he announced. </span>"God's Kingdom is near! Turn from your sins
        and act on this glorious news!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>One day as Jesus was walking along the
        shores of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew
        fishing with nets, for they were commercial fishermen.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus called out to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Come, follow me! And I will make you fishermen for the souls of men!"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">18</span>At once they left their nets and went
        along with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>A little farther up the beach, he saw
        Zebedee's sons, James and John, in a boat mending their nets.
        <span className="sup">20</span>He called them too, and immediately they
        left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with
        him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Jesus and his companions now arrived at
        the town of Capernaum and on Saturday morning went into the Jewish place
        of worship--the synagogue--where he preached.
        <span className="sup">22</span>The congregation was surprised at his
        sermon because he spoke as an authority, and didn't try to prove his
        points by quoting others--quite unlike what they were used to hearing!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>A man possessed by a demon was present
        and began shouting, <span className="sup">24</span>"Why are you
        bothering us, Jesus of Nazareth--have you come to destroy us demons? I
        know who you are--the holy Son of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Jesus curtly commanded the demon to say
        no more and to come out of the man. <span className="sup">26</span>At
        that the evil spirit screamed and convulsed the man violently and left
        him.
        <span className="sup">27</span>Amazement gripped the audience and they
        began discussing what had happened.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "What sort of new religion is this?" they asked excitedly. "Why, even
        evil spirits obey his orders!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>The news of what he done spread quickly
        through that entire area of Galilee.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30</span>Then, leaving the synagogue, he and
        his disciples went over to Simon and Andrew's home, where they found
        Simon's mother-in-law sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus
        about her right away. <span className="sup">31</span>He went to her
        bedside, and as he took her by the hand and helped her to sit up, the
        fever suddenly left, and she got up and prepared dinner for them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32,33</span>By sunset the courtyard was filled
        with the sick and demon-possessed, brought to him for healing; and a
        huge crowd of people from all over the city of Capernaum gathered
        outside the door to watch. <span className="sup">34</span>So Jesus
        healed great numbers of sick folk that evening and ordered many demons
        to come out of their victims. (But he refused to allow the demons to
        speak, because they knew who he was.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The next morning he was up long before
        daybreak and went out alone into the wilderness to pray.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36,37</span>Later, Simon and the others went out
        to find him, and told him, "Everyone is asking for you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>But he replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "We must go on to other towns as well, and give my message to them
          too, for that is why I came."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>So he traveled throughout the province of
        Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and releasing many from the power
        of demons. <span className="sup">40</span>Once a leper came and knelt in
        front of him and begged to be healed. "If you want to, you can make me
        well again," he pled.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>And Jesus, moved with pity, touched him
        and said, <span class="jesus">"I want to! Be healed!"</span>
        <span className="sup">42</span>Immediately the leprosy was gone--the man
        was healed!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>Jesus then told him sternly,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Go and be examined immediately by the Jewish priest. Don't stop to
          speak to anyone along the way. Take along the offering prescribed by
          Moses for a leper who is healed, so that everyone will have proof that
          you are well again."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>But as the man went on his way he began
        to shout the good news that he was healed; as a result, such throngs
        soon surrounded Jesus that he couldn't publicly enter a city anywhere,
        but had to stay out in the barren wastelands. And people from everywhere
        came to him there.
