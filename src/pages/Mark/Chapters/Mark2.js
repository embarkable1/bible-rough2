      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Several days later he returned to Capernaum, and the news of his arrival
        spread quickly through the city. <span className="sup">2</span>Soon the
        house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there wasn't
        room for a single person more, not even outside the door. And he
        preached the Word to them. <span className="sup">3</span>Four men
        arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher.{' '}
        <span className="sup">4</span>They couldn't get to Jesus through the
        crowd, so they dug through the clay roof above his head and lowered the
        sick man on his stretcher, right down in front of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>When Jesus saw how strongly they believed
        that he would help, Jesus said to the sick man,
        <span class="jesus">"Son, your sins are forgiven!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>But some of the Jewish religious leaders
        said to themselves as they sat there, <span className="sup">7</span>
        "What? This is blasphemy! Does he think he is God? For only God can
        forgive sins."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus could read their minds and said to
        them at once,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why does this bother you? <span className="sup">9,10,11</span>I, the
          Messiah, have the authority on earth to forgive sins. But talk is
          cheap--anybody could say that. So I'll prove it to you by healing this
          man."
          <span>Then, turning to the paralyzed man, he commanded, </span>"Pick
          up your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>The man jumped up, took the stretcher,
        and pushed his way through the stunned onlookers! Then how they praised
        God. "We've never seen anything like this before!" they all exclaimed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then Jesus went out to the seashore
        again, and preached to the crowds that gathered around him.
        <span className="sup">14</span>As he was walking up the beach he saw
        Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at his tax collection booth.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Come with me," <span>Jesus told him. </span>"Come be my disciple."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">And Levi jumped to his feet and went along.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>That night Levi invited his fellow tax
        collectors and many other notorious sinners to be his dinner guests so
        that they could meet Jesus and his disciples. (There were many men of
        this type among the crowds that followed him.)
        <span className="sup">16</span>But when some of the Jewish religious
        leaders saw him eating with these men of ill repute, they said to his
        disciples, "How can he stand it, to eat wit such scum?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>When Jesus heard what they were saying,
        he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Sick people need the doctor, not healthy ones! I haven't come to tell
          good people to repent, but the bad ones."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>John's disciples and the Jewish leaders
        sometimes fasted, that is, went without food as part of their religion.
        One day some people came to Jesus and asked why his disciples didn't do
        this too.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Do friends of the bridegroom refuse to eat at the wedding feast?
          Should they be sad while he is with them?
          <span className="sup">20</span>But some day he will be taken away from
          them, and then they will mourn. <span className="sup">21</span>
          [Besides, going without food is part of the old way of doing things.]
          It is like patching an old garment with unshrunk cloth! What happens?
          The patch pulls away and leaves the hole worse than before.
          <span className="sup">22</span>You know better than to put new wine
          into old wineskins. They would burst. The wine would be spilled out
          and the wineskins ruined. New wine needs fresh wineskins."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Another time, on a Sabbath day as Jesus
        and his disciples were walking through the fields, the disciples were
        breaking off heads of wheat and eating the grain.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Some of the Jewish religious leaders said
        to Jesus, "They shouldn't be doing that! It's against our laws to work
        by harvesting grain on the Sabbath."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25,26</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Didn't you ever hear about the time King David and his companions
          were hungry, and he went into the house of God--Abiathar was High
          Priest then--and they ate the special bread only priests were allowed
          to eat? That was against the law too. <span className="sup">27</span>
          But the Sabbath was made to benefit man, and not man to benefit the
          Sabbath. <span className="sup">28</span>And I, the Messiah, have
          authority even to decide what men can do on Sabbath days!"
        </span>
      </p>
