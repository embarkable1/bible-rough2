      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Early in the morning the chief priests, elders and teachers of
        religion--the entire Supreme Court--met to discuss their next steps.
        Their decision was to send Jesus under armed guard to Pilate, the Roman
        governor.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the
        Jews?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Yes," <span>Jesus replied, </span>"it is as you say."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3,4</span>Then the chief priests accused him of
        many crimes, and Pilate asked him, "Why don't you say something? What
        about all these charges against you?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>But Jesus said no more, much to Pilate's
        amazement.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Now, it was Pilate's custom to release one
        Jewish prisoner each year at Passover time--any prisoner the people
        requested. <span className="sup">7</span>One of the prisoners at that
        time was Barabbas, convicted along with others for murder during an
        insurrection.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Now a mob began to crowd in toward Pilate,
        asking him to release a prisoner as usual.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"How about giving you the 'King of Jews'?"
        Pilate asked. "Is he the one you want released?"
        <span className="sup">10</span>(For he realized by now that this was a
        frameup, backed by the chief priests because they envied Jesus'
        popularity.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>But at this point the chief priests
        whipped up the mob to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"But if I release Barabbas," Pilate asked
        them, "what shall I do with this man you call your king?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"But why?" Pilate demanded. "What has he
        done wrong?" They only roared the louder, "Crucify him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then Pilate, afraid of a riot and anxious
        to please the people, released Barabbas to them. And he ordered Jesus
        flogged with a leaded whip, and handed him over to be crucified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16,17</span>Then the Roman soldiers took him into
        the barracks of the palace, called out the entire palace guard, dressed
        him in a purple robe, and made a crown of long, sharp thorns and put it
        on his head. <span className="sup">18</span>Then they saluted, yelling,
        "Yea! King of the Jews!" <span className="sup">19</span>And they beat
        him on the head with a cane, and spit on him and went down on their
        knees to "worship" him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>When they finally tired of their sport,
        they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again, and
        led him away to be crucified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from
        the country just then, was pressed into service to carry Jesus' cross.
        (Simon is the father of Alexander and Rufus.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>And they brought Jesus to a place called
        Golgotha. (Golgotha means skull.) <span className="sup">23</span>Wine
        drugged with bitter herbs was offered to him there, but he refused it.
        <span className="sup">24</span>And then they crucified him--and threw
        dice for his clothes.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>It was about nine o'clock in the morning
        when the crucifixion took place.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>A signboard was fastened to the cross
        above his head, announcing his crime. It read, "The King of the Jews."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Two robbers were also crucified that
        morning, their crosses on either side of his.
        <sup>
          28 <small>Isaiah 53:12</small>{' '}
        </sup>
        And so the Scripture was fulfilled that said, "He was counted among evil
        men."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30</span>The people jeered at him as they
        walked by, and wagged their heads in mockery.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Ha! Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "Sure, you can destroy the
        Temple and rebuild in three days! If you're so wonderful, save yourself
        and come down from the cross."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>The chief priests and religious leaders
        were also standing around joking about Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "He's quite clever at 'saving' others," they said, "but he can't save
        himself!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"Hey there, Messiah!" they yelled at him.
        "You 'King of Israel'! Come on down from the cross and we'll believe
        you!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And even the two robbers dying with him, cursed him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>About noon, darkness fell across the
        entire land, lasting until three o'clock that afternoon.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Then Jesus called out with a loud voice,
        <span class="jesus">"Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?"</span> ("My God, my
        God, why have you deserted me?")
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Some of these people standing there
        thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.{' '}
        <span className="sup">36</span>So one man ran and got a sponge and
        filled it with sour wine and held it up to him on a stick.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Let's see if Elijah will come and take him down!" he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Then Jesus uttered another loud cry, and
        dismissed his spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>And the curtain in the Temple was split
        apart from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>When the Roman officer standing beside
        his cross saw how he dismissed his spirit, he exclaimed, "Truly, this
        was the Son of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>Some women were there watching from a
        distance--Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the Younger and of
        Joses), Salome, and others. <span className="sup">41</span>They and many
        other Galilean women who were his followers had ministered to him when
        he was up in Galilee, and had come with him to Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42,43</span>This all happened the day before the
        Sabbath. Late that afternoon Joseph from Arimathea, an honored member of
        the Jewish Supreme Court (who personally was eagerly expecting the
        arrival of God's Kingdom), gathered his courage and went to Pilate and
        asked for Jesus' body.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>Pilate couldn't believe that Jesus was
        already dead so he called for the Roman officer in charge and asked him.
        <span className="sup">45</span>The officer confirmed the fact, and
        Pilate told Joseph he could have the body.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Joseph brought a long sheet of linen
        cloth and, taking Jesus' body down from the cross, wound it in the cloth
        and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb, and rolled a stone in front of the
        entrance.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>(Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of
        Joses were watching as Jesus was laid away.)
