      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Here are some of the story-illustrations Jesus gave to the people at
        that time:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "A man planted a vineyard and built a wall around it and dug a pit for
        pressing out the grape juice, and built a watchman's tower. Then he
        leased the farm to tenant farmers and moved to another country.
        <span className="sup">2</span>At grape-picking time he sent one of his
        men to collect his share of the crop. <span className="sup">3</span>But
        the farmers beat up the man and sent him back empty-handed.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"The owner then sent another of his men,
        who received the same treatment, only worse, for his head was seriously
        injured. <span className="sup">5</span>The next man he sent was killed;
        and later, others were either beaten or killed, until
        <span className="sup">6</span>there was only one left--his only son. He
        finally sent him, thinking they would surely give him their full
        respect.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"But when the farmers saw him coming they
        said, 'He will own the farm when his father dies. Come on, let's kill
        him--and then the farm will be ours!" <span className="sup">8</span>So
        they caught him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"What do you suppose the owner will do
        when he hears what happened? He will come and kill them all, and lease
        the vineyard to others. <span className="sup">10</span>Don't you
        remember reading this verse in the Scriptures? 'The Rock the builders
        threw away became the cornerstone, the most honored stone in the
        building!
        <span className="sup">11</span>This is the Lord's doing and it is an
        amazing thing to see.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>The Jewish leaders wanted to arrest him
        then and there for using this illustration, for they knew he was
        pointing at them--they were the wicked farmers in his story. But they
        were afraid to touch him for fear of a mob. So they left him and went
        away.
        <span className="sup">13</span>But they sent other religious and
        political leaders to talk with him and try to trap him into saying
        something he could be arrested for.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Teacher," these spies said, "we know you
        tell the truth no matter what! You aren't influenced by the opinions and
        desires of men, but sincerely teach the ways of God. Now tell us, is it
        right to pay taxes to Rome, or not?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Jesus saw their trick and said,
        <span class="jesus">"Show me a coin and I'll tell you."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>When they handed it to him he asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Whose picture and title is this on the coin?"
        </span>
        They replied, "The emperor's."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "All right," <span>he said, </span>"if it is his, give it to him. But
          everything that belongs to God must be given to God!"
        </span>
        And they scratched their heads in bafflement at his reply.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Then the Sadducees stepped forward--a
        group of men who say there is no resurrection. Here was their question:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Teacher, Moses gave us a law that when a
        man dies without children, the man's brother should marry his widow and
        have children in his brother's name.{' '}
        <span className="sup">20,21,22</span>Well, there were seven brothers and
        the oldest married and died, and left no children. So the second brother
        married the widow, but soon he died too, and left no children. Then the
        next brother married her, and died without children, and so on until all
        were dead, and still there were no children; and last of all, the woman
        died too.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"What we want to know is this: In the
        resurrection, whose wife will she be, for she had been the wife of each
        of them?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Your trouble is that you don't know the Scriptures, and don't know
          the power of God. <span className="sup">25</span>For when these seven
          brothers and the woman rise from the dead, they won't be married--they
          will be like the angels.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"But now as to whether there will be a
        resurrection--have you never read in the book of Exodus about Moses and
        the burning bush? God said to Moses, 'I <em>am</em> the God of Abraham,
        and I <em>am</em> the God of Isaac, and I <em>am</em> the God of Jacob.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"God was telling Moses that these men,
        though dead for hundreds of years, were still very much alive, for he
        would not have said, 'I <em>am</em> the God' of those who don't exist!
        You have made a serious error."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>One of the teachers of religion who was
        standing there listening to the discussion realized that Jesus had
        answered well. So he asked, "Of all the commandments, which is the most
        important?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The one that says, 'Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is the one and
          only God. <span className="sup">30</span>And you must love him with
          all your heart and soul and mind and strength.'
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"The second is: 'You must love others as
        much as yourself.' No other commandments are greater than these."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>The teacher of religion replied, "Sir,
        you have spoken a true word in saying that there is only one God and no
        other. <span className="sup">33</span>And I know it is far more
        important to love him with all my heart and understanding and strength,
        and to love others as myself, than to offer all kinds of sacrifices on
        the altar of the Temple."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Realizing this man's understanding, Jesus
        said to him,
        <span class="jesus">"You are not far from the Kingdom of God." </span>
        And after that, no one dared ask him any more questions.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Later, as Jesus was teaching the people
        in the Temple area, he asked them this question:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Why do your religious teachers claim that the Messiah must be a
        descendant of King David? <span className="sup">36</span>For David
        himself said--and the Holy Spirit was speaking through him when he said
        it--'God said to my Lord, sit at my right hand until I make your enemies
        your footstool.' <span className="sup">37</span>Since David called him
        his Lord, how can he be his <em>son?</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        (This sort of reasoning delighted the crowd and they listened to him
        with great interest.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Here are some of the other things he
        taught them at this time:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Beware of the teachers of religion! For they love to wear the robes of
        the rich and scholarly, and to have everyone bow to them as they walk
        through the markets. <span className="sup">39</span>They love to sit in
        the best seats in the synagogues, and at the places of honor at
        banquets--
        <span className="sup">40</span>but they shamelessly cheat widows out of
        their homes and then, to cover up the kind of men they really are, they
        pretend to be pious by praying long prayers in public. Because of this,
        their punishment will be the greater."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then he went over to the collection boxes
        in the Temple and sat and watched as the crowds dropped in their money.
        Some who were rich put in large amounts. <span className="sup">42</span>
        Then a poor widow came and dropped in two pennies.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>He called his disciples to him and
        remarked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "That poor widow has given more than all those rich men put together!
          For they gave a little of their extra fat, while she gave up her last
          penny."
        </span>
      </p>
