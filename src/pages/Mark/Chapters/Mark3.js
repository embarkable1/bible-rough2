      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        While in Capernaum Jesus went over to the synagogue again, and noticed a
        man there with a deformed hand.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus' enemies
        watched him closely. Would he heal the man's hand? If he did, they
        planned to arrest him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Jesus asked the man to come and stand in
        front of the congregation. <span className="sup">4</span>Then turning to
        his enemies he asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Is it all right to do kind deeds on Sabbath days? Or is this a day
          for doing harm? Is it a day to save lives or to destroy them?{' '}
        </span>
        But they wouldn't answer him. <span className="sup">5</span>Looking
        around at them angrily, for he was deeply disturbed by their
        indifference to human need, he said to the man,
        <span class="jesus">"Reach out your hand." </span>He did, and instantly
        his hand was healed!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>At once the Pharisees went away and met
        with the Herodians to discuss plans for killing Jesus.
        <span className="sup">7,8</span>Meanwhile, Jesus and his disciples
        withdrew to the beach, followed by a huge crowd from all over Galilee,
        Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan River, and even
        from as far away as Tyre and Sidon. For the news about his miracles had
        spread far and wide and vast numbers came to see him for themselves.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>He instructed his disciples to bring
        around a boat and to have it standing ready to rescue him in case he was
        crowded off the beach. <span className="sup">10</span>For there had been
        many healings that day and as a result great numbers of sick people were
        crowding around him, trying to touch him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And whenever those possessed by demons
        caught sight of him they would fall down before him shrieking, "You are
        the Son of God!" <span className="sup">12</span>But he strictly warned
        them not to make him known.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Afterwards he went up into the hills and
        summoned certain ones he chose, inviting them to come and join him
        there; and they did. <span className="sup">14,15</span>Then he selected
        twelve of them to be his regular companions and to go out to preach and
        to cast out demons. <span className="sup">16-19</span>These are the
        names of the twelve he chose:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Simon (he renamed him "Peter"),</p>
      <p className="quote">
        James and John (the sons of Zebedee, but Jesus called them "Sons of
        Thunder"),
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Andrew,</p>
      <p className="quote">Philip,</p>
      <p className="quote">Bartholomew,</p>
      <p className="quote">Matthew,</p>
      <p className="quote">Thomas,</p>
      <p className="quote">James (the son of Alphaeus),</p>
      <p className="quote">Thaddeus,</p>
      <p className="quote">
        Simon (a member of a political party advocating violent overthrow of the
        Roman government),
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>When he returned to the house where he
        was staying, the crowds began to gather again, and soon it was so full
        of visitors that he couldn't even find time to eat.
        <span className="sup">21</span>When his friends heard what was happening
        they came to try to take him home with them.

      <p className="quote">"He's out of his mind," they said.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>But the Jewish teachers of religion who
        had arrived from Jerusalem said, "His trouble is that he's possessed by
        Satan, king of demons. That's why demon's obey him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus summoned these men and asked them
        (using proverbs they all understood),
        <span class="jesus">
          "How can Satan cast out Satan? <span className="sup">24</span>A
          kingdom divided against itself will collapse.{' '}
          <span className="sup">25</span>A home filled with strife and division
          destroys itself.
          <span className="sup">26</span>And if Satan is fighting against
          himself, how can he accomplish anything? He would never survive.
          <span className="sup">27</span>[Satan must be bound before his demons
          are cast out], just as a strong man must be tied up before his house
          can be ransacked and his property robbed.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28 </span>"I solemnly declare that any sin of man
        can be forgiven, even blasphemy against me;{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>but blasphemy against the Holy Spirit can
        never be forgiven. It is an eternal sin."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>He told them this because they were
        saying he did his miracles by Satan's power [instead of acknowledging it
        was by the Holy Spirit's power].

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31,32</span>Now his mother and brothers arrived at

        want to see you," he was told.

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>He replied,
