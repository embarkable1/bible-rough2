      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day about this time as another great crowd gathered, the people ran
        out of food again. Jesus called his disciples to discuss the situation.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "I pity these people," <span>he said, </span>"for they have been here
        three days, and have nothing left to eat. <span className="sup">3</span>
        And if I send them home without feeding them, they will faint along the
        road! For some of them have come a long distance."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"Are we supposed to find food for them
        here in the desert?" his disciples scoffed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>
        <span class="jesus">"How many loaves of bread do you have?"</span> he
        asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Seven," they replied. <span className="sup">6</span>So he told the
        crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, thanked
        God for them, broke them into pieces and passed them to his disciples;
        and the disciples placed them before the people.{' '}
        <span className="sup">7</span>A few small fish were found, too, so Jesus
        also blessed these and told the disciples to serve them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>And the whole crowd ate until they were
        full, and afterwards he sent them home. There were about 4,000 people in
        the crowd that day and when the scraps were picked up after the meal,
        there were seven very large basketfuls left over!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Immediately after this he got into a boat
        with his disciples and came to the region of Dalmanutha.
        <span className="sup">11</span>When the local Jewish leaders learned of
        his arrival they came to argue with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Do a miracle for us," they said. "Make something happen in the sky.
        Then we will believe in you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>He sighed deeply when he heard this and
        he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Certainly not. How many more miracles do you people need?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>So he got back into the boat and left
        them, and crossed to the other side of the lake.
        <span className="sup">14</span>But the disciples had forgotten to stock
        up on food before they left, and had only one loaf of bread in the boat.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>As they were crossing, Jesus said to them
        very solemnly,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Beware of the yeast of King Herod and of the Pharisees."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"What does he mean?" the disciples asked
        each other. They finally decided that he must be talking about their
        forgetting to bring bread.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus realized what they were discussing
        and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "No, that isn't it at all! Can't you understand? Are your hearts too
          hard to take it in? <span className="sup">18</span>'Your eyes are to
          see with--why don't you look? Why don't you open your ears and
          listen?' Don't you remember anything at all?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"What about the 5,000 men I fed with five
        loaves of bread? How many basketfuls of scraps did you pick up
        afterwards?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Twelve," they said.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"And when I fed the 4,000 with seven
        loaves, how much was left?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Seven basketfuls," they said.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"And yet you think I'm worried that we
        have no bread?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>When they arrived at Bethsaida, some
        people brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch and heal him.
        <span className="sup">23</span>Jesus took the blind man by the hand and
        led him out of the village, and spat upon his eyes, and laid his hands
        over them.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Can you see anything now?" <span>Jesus asked him.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>The man looked around. "Yes!" he said, "I
        see men! But I can't see them very clearly; they look like tree trunks
        walking around!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Then Jesus placed his hands over the
        man's eyes again and as the man stared intently, his sight was
        completely restored, and he saw everything clearly, drinking in the
        sights around him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Jesus sent him home to his family.
        <span class="jesus">"Don't even go back to the village first," </span>he
        said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Jesus and his disciples now left Galilee
        and went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking
        along he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Who do the people think I am? What are they saying about me?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"Some of them think you are John the
        Baptist," the disciples replied, "and others say you are Elijah or some
        other ancient prophet come back to life again."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Then he asked,
        <span class="jesus">"Who do you think I am?" </span>Peter replied, "You
        are the Messiah." <span className="sup">30</span>But Jesus warned them
        not to tell anyone!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Then he began to tell them about the
        terrible things he would suffer, and that the would be rejected by the
        elders and the Chief Priests and the other Jewish leaders--and be
        killed, and that he would rise again three days afterwards.{' '}
        <span className="sup">32</span>He talked about it quite frankly with
        them, so Peter took him aside and chided him. "You shouldn't say things
        like that," he told Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Jesus turned and looked at his disciples
        and then said to Peter very sternly,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Satan, get behind me! You are looking at this only from a human point
          of view and not from God's."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Then he called his disciples and the
        crowds to come over and listen.
        <span class="jesus">"If any of you wants to be my follower,"</span> he
        told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "you must put aside your own pleasures and shoulder your cross, and
          follow me closely. <span className="sup">35</span>If you insist on
          saving your life, you will lose it. Only those who throw away their
          lives for my sake and for the sake of the Good News will ever know
          what it means to really live.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"And how does a man benefit if he gains
        the whole world and loses his soul in the process?
        <span className="sup">37</span>For is anything worth more than his soul?
        <span className="sup">38</span>And anyone who is ashamed of me and my
        message in these days of unbelief and sin, I, the Messiah, will be
        ashamed of him when I return in the glory of my Father, with the holy
        angels."
