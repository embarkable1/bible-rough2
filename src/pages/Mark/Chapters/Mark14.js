      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        The Passover observance began two days later--an annual Jewish holiday
        when no bread made with yeast was eaten. The chief priests and other
        Jewish leaders were still looking for an opportunity to arrest Jesus
        secretly and put him to death.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"But we can't do it during the Passover,"
        they said, "or there will be a riot."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Meanwhile Jesus was in Bethany, at the
        home of Simon the leper; during supper a woman came in with a beautiful
        flask of expensive perfume. Then, breaking the seal, she poured it over
        his head.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4,5</span>Some of those at the table were
        indignant among themselves about this "waste," as they called it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Why, she could have sold that perfume for a fortune and given the money
        to the poor!" they snarled.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let her alone; why berate her for doing a good thing?
          <span className="sup">7</span>You always have the poor among you, and
          they badly need your help, and you can aid them whenever you want to;
          but I won't be here much longer.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"She has done what she could, and has
        anointed my body ahead of time for burial.{' '}
        <span className="sup">9</span>And I tell you this in solemn truth, that
        wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's
        deed will be remembered and praised."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>Then Judas Iscariot, one of his
        disciples, went to the chief priests to arrange to betray Jesus to them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>When the chief priests heard why he had
        come, they were excited and happy and promised him a reward. So he began
        looking for the right time and place to betray Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>On the first day of the Passover, the day
        the lambs were sacrificed, his disciples asked him where he wanted to go
        to eat the traditional Passover supper. <span className="sup">13</span>
        He sent two of them into Jerusalem to make the arrangements.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "As you are walking along," <span>he told them, </span>"you will see a
        man coming towards you carrying a pot of water. Follow him.
        <span className="sup">14</span>At the house he enters, tell the man in
        charge, 'Our Master sent us to see the room you have ready for us, where
        we will eat the Passover supper this evening!'
        <span className="sup">15</span>He will take you upstairs to a large room
        all set up. Prepare our supper there."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>So the two disciples went on ahead into
        the city and found everything as Jesus had said, and prepared the
        Passover.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>In the evening Jesus arrived with the
        other disciples, <span className="sup">18</span>and as they were sitting
        around the table eating, Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I solemnly declare that one of you will betray me, one of you who is
          here eating with me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>A great sadness swept over them, and one
        by one they asked him, "Am I the one?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is one of you twelve eating with me now.
          <span className="sup">21</span>I must die, as the prophets declared
          long ago; but, oh, the misery ahead for the man by whom I am betrayed.
          Oh, that he had never been born!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>As they were eating, Jesus took bread and
        asked God's blessing on it and broke it in pieces and gave it to them
        and said, <span class="jesus">"Eat it--this is my body."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then he took a cup of wine and gave
        thanks to God for it and gave it to them; and they all drank from it.
        <span className="sup">24</span>And he said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "This is my blood, poured out for many, sealing the new agreement
          between God and man. <span className="sup">25</span>I solemnly declare
          that I shall never again taste wine until the day I drink a different
          kind in the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then they sang a hymn and went out to the
        Mount of Olives.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"All of you will desert me,"
        <span>Jesus told them, </span>"for God has declared through the
        prophets, 'I will kill the Shepherd, and the sheep will scatter.'
        <span className="sup">28</span>But after I am raised to life again, I
        will go to Galilee and meet you there."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Peter said to him, "I will never desert
        you no matter what the others do!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"Peter," <span>Jesus said, </span>"before
        the cock crows a second time tomorrow morning you will deny me three
        times."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"No!" Peter exploded. "Not even if I have
        to die with you! I'll <em>never</em> deny you!" And all the others vowed
        the same.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>And now they came to an olive grove
        called the Garden of Gethsemane, and he instructed his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">"Sit here, while I go and pray."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>He took Peter, James and John with him
        and began to be filled with horror and deepest distress.
        <span className="sup">34</span>And he said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My soul is crushed by sorrow to the point of death; stay here and
          watch with me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>He went on a little further and fell to
        the ground and prayed that if it were possible the awful hour awaiting
        him might never come.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"Father, Father,"
        <span>he said, </span>"everything is possible for you. Take away this
        cup from me. Yet I want your will, not mine."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>Then he returned to the three disciples
        and found them asleep.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Simon!" <span>he said. </span>"Asleep? Couldn't you watch with me even
        one hour? <span className="sup">38</span>Watch with me and pray lest the
        Tempter overpower you. For though the spirit is willing enough, the body
        is weak."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>And he went away again and prayed,
        repeating his pleadings. <span className="sup">40</span>Again he
        returned to them and found them sleeping, for they were very tired. And
        they didn't know what to say.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>The third time when he returned to them
        he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Sleep on; get your rest! But no! The time for sleep has ended! Look!
          I am betrayed into the hands of wicked men.
          <span className="sup">42</span>Come! Get up! We must go! Look! My
          betrayer is here!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>And immediately, while he was still
        speaking, Judas (one of his disciples) arrived with a mob equipped with
        swords and clubs, sent out by the chief priests and other Jewish
        leaders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>Judas had told them, "You will know which
        one to arrest when I go over and greet him. Then you can take him
        easily."
        <span className="sup">45</span>So as soon as they arrived he walked up
        to Jesus, "Master!" he exclaimed, and embraced him with a great show of
        friendliness. <span className="sup">46</span>Then the mob arrested Jesus
        and held him fast. <span className="sup">47</span>But someone pulled a
        sword and slashed at the High Priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>Jesus asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Am I some dangerous robber, that you come like this, armed to the
          teeth to capture me? <span className="sup">49</span>Why didn't you
          arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day. But these
          things are happening to fulfill the prophecies about me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Meanwhile, all his disciples had fled.
        <span className="sup">51,52</span>There was, however, a young man
        following along behind, clothed only in a linen nightshirt. When the mob
        tried to grab him, he escaped, though his clothes were torn off in the
        process, so that he ran away completely naked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">53</span>Jesus was led to the High Priest's home
        where all of the chief priests and other Jewish leaders soon gathered.
        <span className="sup">54</span>Peter followed far behind and then
        slipped inside the gates of the High Priest's residence and crouched
        beside a fire among the servants.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>Inside, the chief priests and the whole
        Jewish Supreme Court were trying to find something against Jesus that
        would be sufficient to condemn him to death. But their efforts were in
        vain. <span className="sup">56</span>Many false witnesses volunteered,
        but they contradicted each other.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>Finally some men stood up to lie about
        him and said, <span className="sup">58</span>"We heard him say, 'I will
        destroy this Temple made with human hands and in three days I will build
        another, made without human hands!'" <span className="sup">59</span>But
        even then they didn't get their stories straight!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>Then the High Priest stood up before the
        Court and asked Jesus, "Do you refuse to answer this charge? What do you
        have to say for yourself?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>To this Jesus made no reply.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then the High Priest asked him. "Are you the Messiah, the Son of God?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">62</span>Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I am, and you will see me sitting at the right hand of God, and
          returning to earth in the clouds of heaven."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">63,64</span>Then the High Priest tore at his
        clothes and said, "What more do we need? Why wait for witnesses? You
        have heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?" And the vote for the
        death sentence was unanimous.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>Then some of them began to spit at him,
        and they blindfolded him and began to hammer his face with their fists.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Who hit you that time, you prophet?" they jeered. And even the bailiffs
        were using their fists on him as they led him away.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">66,67</span>Meanwhile Peter was below in the
        courtyard. One of the maids who worked for the High Priest noticed Peter
        warming himself at the fire.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        She looked at him closely and then announced, " <em>You</em> were with
        Jesus, the Nazarene."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">68</span>Peter denied it. "I don't know what
        you're talking about!" he said, and walked over to the edge of the
        courtyard.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Just then, a rooster crowed.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">69</span>The maid saw him standing there and began
        telling the others, "There he is! There's that disciple of Jesus!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">70</span>Peter denied it again.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        A little later others standing around the fire began saying to Peter,
        "You are, too, one of them, for you are from Galilee!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">71</span>He began to curse and swear. "I don't
        even know this fellow you are talking about," he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">72</span>And immediately the rooster crowed the
        second time. Suddenly Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind: "Before
        the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." And he began to
        cry.
