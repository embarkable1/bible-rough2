      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus went on to say to his disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Some of you who are standing here right now will live to see the
          Kingdom of God arrive in great power!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Six days later Jesus took Peter, James and
        John to the top of a mountain. No one else was there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Suddenly, his face began to shine with glory,
        <span className="sup">3</span>and his clothing became dazzling white,
        far more glorious than any earthly process could ever make it!
        <span className="sup">4</span>Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began
        talking with Jesus!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Teacher, this is wonderful!" Peter
        exclaimed. "We will make three shelters here, one for each of you . . .
        ."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>He said this just to be talking, for he
        didn't know what else to say and they were all terribly frightened.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>But while he was still speaking these
        words, a cloud covered them, blotting out the sun, and a voice from the
        cloud said, " <em>This</em> is my beloved Son. Listen to <em>him.</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Then suddenly they looked around and Moses
        and Elijah were gone, and only Jesus was with them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>As they descended the mountainside he told
        them never to mention what they had seen until after he had risen from
        the dead. <span className="sup">10</span>So they kept it to themselves,
        but often talked about it, and wondered what he meant by "rising from
        the dead."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now they began asking him about something
        the Jewish religious leaders often spoke of, that Elijah must return
        [before the Messiah could come]. <span className="sup">12,13</span>Jesus
        agreed that Elijah must come first and prepare the way--and that he had,
        in fact, already come! And that he had been terribly mistreated, just as
        the prophets had predicted. Then Jesus asked them what the prophets
        could have been talking about when they predicted that the Messiah would
        suffer and be treated with utter contempt.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>At the bottom of the mountain they found
        a great crowd surrounding the other nine disciples, as some Jewish
        leaders argued with them. <span className="sup">15</span>The crowd
        watched Jesus in awe as he came toward them, and then ran to greet him.
        <span className="sup">16</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What's all the argument about?"</span> he asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>One of the men in the crowd spoke up and
        said, "Teacher, I brought my son for you to heal--he can't talk because
        he is possessed by a demon. <span className="sup">18</span>And whenever
        the demon is in control of him it dashes him to the ground and makes him
        foam at the mouth and grind his teeth and become rigid. So I begged your
        disciples to cast out the demon, but they couldn't do it."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Jesus said [to his disciples],
        <span class="jesus">
          "Oh, what tiny faith you have; how much longer must I be with you
          until you believe? How much longer must I be patient with you? Bring
          the boy to me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>So they brought the boy, but when he saw
        Jesus the demon convulsed the child horribly, and he fell to the ground
        writhing and foaming at the mouth.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>
        <span class="jesus">"How long has he been this way?"</span> Jesus asked
        the father.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And he replied, "Since he was very small,{' '}
        <span className="sup">22</span>and the demon often makes him fall into
        the fire or into water to kill him. Oh, have mercy on us and do
        something if you can."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "If I can?" <span>Jesus asked. </span>" <em>Anything</em> is possible
          if you have faith."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>The father instantly replied, "I
        <em>do</em> have faith; oh, help me to have <em>more!</em>"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>When Jesus saw the crowd was growing he
        rebuked the demon.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "O demon of deafness and dumbness," <span>he said, </span>"I command you
        to come out of this child and enter him no more!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then the demon screamed terribly and
        convulsed the boy again and left him; and the boy lay there limp and
        motionless, to all appearance dead. A murmur ran through the crowd--"He
        is dead." <span className="sup">27</span>But Jesus took him by the hand
        and helped him to his feet and he stood up and was all right!
        <span className="sup">28</span>Afterwards, when Jesus was alone in the
        house with his disciples, they asked him, "Why couldn't we cast that
        demon out?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">"Cases like this require prayer."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30,31</span>Leaving that region they traveled
        through Galilee where he tried to avoid all publicity in order to spend
        more time with his disciples, teaching them. He would say to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I, the Messiah, am going to be betrayed and killed and three days
          later will return to life again."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>But they didn't understand and were
        afraid to ask him what he meant.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>And so they arrived at Capernaum. When
        they were settled in the house where they were to stay he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"What were you discussing out on the road?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>But they were ashamed to answer, for they
        had been arguing about which of them was the greatest!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>He sat down and called them around him
        and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Anyone wanting to be the greatest must be the least--the servant of
          all!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then he placed a little child among them;
        and taking the child in his arms he said to them,
        <span className="sup">37</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name is welcoming
          me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming my Father who sent me!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>One of his disciples, John, told him one
        day, "Teacher, we saw a man using your name to cast out demons; but we
        told him not to, for he isn't one of our group."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Don't forbid him!"
        <span>Jesus said. </span>"For no one doing miracles in my name will
        quickly turn against me. <span className="sup">40</span>Anyone who isn't
        against us is for us. <span className="sup">41</span>If anyone so much
        as gives you a cup of water because you are Christ's--I say this
        solemnly--he won't lose his reward. <span className="sup">42</span>But
        if someone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to lose
        faith--it would be better for that man if a huge millstone were tied
        around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>"If your hand does wrong, cut it off.
        Better live forever with one hand than be thrown into the unquenchable
        fires of hell with two! <span className="sup">45,46</span>If your foot
        carries you toward evil, cut it off! Better be lame and live forever
        than have two feet that carry you to hell.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>"And if your eye is sinful, gouge it out.
        Better enter the Kingdom of God half blind than have two eyes and see
        the fires of hell, <span className="sup">48</span>where the worm never
        dies, and the fire never goes out-- <span className="sup">49</span>where
        all are salted with fire.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>"Good salt is worthless if it loses its
        saltiness; it can't season anything. So don't lose your flavor! Live in
        peace with each other."
