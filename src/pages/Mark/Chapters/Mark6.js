      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Soon afterwards he left that section of the country and returned with
        his disciples to Nazareth, his home town.
        <span className="sup">2,3</span>The next Sabbath he went to the
        synagogue to teach, and the people were astonished at his wisdom and his
        miracles because he was just a local man like themselves.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "He's no better than we are," they said. "He's just a carpenter, Mary's
        boy, and a brother of James and Joseph, Judas and Simon. And his sisters
        live right here among us." And they were offended!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>Then Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his home town and among his
          relatives and by his own family."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">5</span>And because of their unbelief he couldn't
        do any mighty miracles among them except to place his hands on a few
        sick people and heal them. <span className="sup">6</span>And he could
        hardly accept the fact that they wouldn't believe in him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then he went out among the villages, teaching.
        <span className="sup">7</span>And he called his twelve disciples
        together and sent them out two by two, with power to cast out demons.
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>He told them to take nothing with them
        except their walking sticks--no food, no knapsack, no money, not even an
        extra pair of shoes or a change of clothes.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"Stay at one home in each village--don't
        shift around from house to house while you are there,"
        <span>
          he said. <span className="sup">11</span>{' '}
        </span>
        "And whenever a village won't accept you or listen to you, shake off the
        dust from your feet as you leave; it is a sign that you have abandoned
        it to its fate."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>So the disciples went out, telling
        everyone they met to turn from sin. <span className="sup">13</span>And
        they cast out many demons, and healed many sick people, anointing them
        with olive oil.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>King Herod soon heard about Jesus, for
        his miracles were talked about everywhere. The king thought Jesus was
        John the Baptist come back to life again. So the people were saying, "No
        wonder he can do such miracles." <span className="sup">15</span>Others
        thought Jesus was Elijah the ancient prophet, now returned to life
        again; still others claimed he was a new prophet like the great ones of
        the past.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"No," Herod said, "it is John, the man I
        beheaded. He has come back from the dead."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17,18</span>For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest
        and imprison John because he kept saying it was wrong for the king to
        marry Heodias, his brother Philip's wife.{' '}
        <span className="sup">19</span>Herodias wanted John killed in revenge,
        but without Herod's approval she was powerless.{' '}
        <span className="sup">20</span>And Herod respected John, knowing that he
        was a good and holy man, and so he kept him under his protection. Herod
        was disturbed whenever he talked with John, but even so he liked to
        listen to him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Herodias' chance finally came. It was
        Herod's birthday and he gave a stag party for his palace aides, army
        officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee.{' '}
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>Then Herodias' daughter came in and
        danced before them and greatly pleased them all.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Ask me for anything you like," the king vowed, "even half of my
        kingdom, and I will give it to you!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>She went out and consulted her mother,
        who told her, "Ask for John the Baptist's head!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>So she turned back to the king and told
        him, "I want the head of John the Baptist--right now--on a tray!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then the king was sorry, but he was
        embarrassed to break his oath in front of his guests.
        <span className="sup">27</span>So he sent one of his bodyguards to the
        prison to cut off John's head and bring it to him. The soldier killed
        John in the prison, <span className="sup">28</span>and brought back his
        head on a tray, and gave it to the girl and she took it to her mother.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>When John's disciples heard what had
        happened, they came for his body and buried it in a tomb.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>The apostles now returned to Jesus from
        their tour and told him all they had done and what they had said to the
        people they visited.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Then Jesus suggested,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let's get away from the crowds for a while and rest."
        </span>
        For so many people were coming and going that they scarcely had time to
        eat. <span className="sup">32</span>So they left by boat for a quieter
        spot.
        <span className="sup">33</span>But many people saw them leaving and ran
        on ahead along the shore and met them as they landed.
        <span className="sup">34</span>So the usual vast crowd was there as he
        stepped from the boat; and he had pity on them because they were like
        sheep without a shepherd, and he taught them many things they needed to
        know.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35,36</span>Late in the afternoon his disciples
        came to him and said, "Tell the people to go away to the nearby villages
        and farms and buy themselves some food, for there is nothing to eat here
        in this desolate spot, and it is getting late."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          " <em>You</em> feed them."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "With what?" they asked. "It would take a fortune to buy food for all
        this crowd!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "How much food do we have?" <span>he asked.</span> "Go and find out."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        They came back to report that there were five loaves of bread and two
        fish. <span className="sup">39,40</span>Then Jesus told the crowd to sit
        down, and soon colorful groups of fifty or a hundred each were sitting
        on the green grass.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>He took the five loaves and two fish and
        looking up to heaven, gave thanks for the food. Breaking the loaves into
        pieces, he gave some of the bread and fish to each disciple to place
        before the people. <span className="sup">42</span>And the crowd ate
        until they could hold no more!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>There were about 5,000 men there for
        that meal, and afterwards twelve basketfuls of scraps were picked up off
        the grass!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Immediately after this Jesus instructed
        his disciples to get back into the boat and strike out across the lake
        to Bethsaida, where he would join them later. He himself would stay and
        tell the crowds good-bye and get them started home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Afterwards he went up into the hills to
        pray.
        <span className="sup">47</span>During the night, as the disciples in
        their boat were out in the middle of the lake, and he was alone on land,
        <span className="sup">48</span>he saw that they were in serious trouble,
        rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        About three o'clock in the morning he walked out to them on them on the
        water. He started past them, <span className="sup">49</span>but when
        they saw something walking along beside them they screamed in terror,
        thinking it was a ghost, <span className="sup">50</span>for they all saw
        him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        But he spoke to them at once.
        <span class="jesus">
          "It's all right," <span>he said. </span>"It is I! Don't be afraid."{' '}
        </span>
        <span className="sup">51</span>Then he climbed into the boat and the
        wind stopped!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        They just sat there, unable to take it in!
        <span className="sup">52</span>For they still didn't realize who he was,
        even after the miracle the evening before! For they didn't want to
        believe!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">53</span>When they arrived at Gennesaret on the
        other side of the lake they moored the boat,{' '}
        <span className="sup">54</span>and climbed out.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        The people standing around there recognized him at once,
        <span className="sup">55</span>and ran throughout the whole area to
        spread the news of his arrival, and began carrying sick folks to him on
        mats and stretchers. <span className="sup">56</span>Wherever he went--in
        villages and cities, and out on the farms--they laid the sick in the
        market plazas and streets, and begged him to let them at least touch the
        fringes of his clothes; and as many as touched him were healed.
