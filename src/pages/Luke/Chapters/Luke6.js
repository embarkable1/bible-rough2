      <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One Sabbath as Jesus and his disciples were walking through some
        grainfields, they were breaking off the heads of wheat, rubbing off the
        husks in their hands and eating the grains.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>But some Pharisees said, "That's illegal!
        Your disciples are harvesting grain, and it's against the Jewish law to
        work on the Sabbath."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't you read the Scriptures? Haven't you ever read what King David
          did when he and his men were hungry? <span className="sup">4</span>He
          went into the Temple and took the shewbread, the special bread that
          was placed before the Lord, and ate it--illegal as this was--and
          shared it with others."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">5</span>And Jesus added,
        <span class="jesus">"I am master even of the Sabbath."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>On another Sabbath he was in the synagogue
        teaching, and a man was present whose right hand was deformed.
        <span className="sup">7</span>The teachers of the Law and the Pharisees
        watched closely to see whether he would heal the man that day, since it
        was the Sabbath. For they were eager to find some charge to bring
        against him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>How well he knew their thoughts! But he
        said to the man with the deformed hand,
        <span class="jesus">"Come and stand here where everyone can see."</span>
        So he did.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then Jesus said to the Pharisees and
        teachers of the Law,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I have a question for you. Is it right to do good on the Sabbath day,
          or to do harm? To save life, or to destroy it?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>He looked around at them one by one and
        then said to the man, <span class="jesus">"Reach out your hand."</span>{' '}
        And as he did, it became completely normal again.
        <span className="sup">11</span>At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild
        with rage, and began to plot his murder.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>One day soon afterwards he went out into
        the mountains to pray, and prayed all night.{' '}
        <span className="sup">13</span>At daybreak he called together his
        followers and chose twelve of them to be the inner circle of his
        disciples. (They were appointed as his "apostles," or "missionaries."){' '}
        <span className="sup">14,15,16</span>Here are their names:
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">Simon (he also called him Peter),</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Andrew (Simon's brother),</p>
      <p className="quote__long">James,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">John,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Philip,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Bartholomew,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Matthew,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Thomas,</p>
      <p className="quote__long">James (the son of Alphaeus),</p>
      <p className="quote__long">
        Simon (a member of the Zealots, a subversive political party),
      </p>
      <p className="quote__long">Judas (son of James),</p>
      <p className="quote__long">Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17,18</span>When they came down the slopes of the
        mountain, they stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by
        many of his followers who, in turn, were surrounded by the crowds. For
        people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as
        the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon had come to hear him or to be healed.
        And he cast out many demons. <span className="sup">19</span>Everyone was
        trying to touch him, for when they did healing power went out from him
        and they were cured.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">20</span>Then he turned to his disciples and
          said,
        </span>
        "What happiness there is for you who are poor, for the Kingdom of God is
        yours! <span className="sup">21</span>What happiness there is for you
        who are now hungry, for you are going to be satisfied! What happiness
        there is for you who weep, for the time will come when you shall laugh
        with joy! <span className="sup">22</span>What happiness it is when
        others hate you and exclude you and insult you and smear your name
        because you are mine! <span className="sup">23</span>When that happens,
        rejoice! Yes, leap for joy! For you will have a great reward awaiting
        you in heaven. And you will be in good company--the ancient prophets
        were treated that way too!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"But, oh, the sorrows that await the
        rich. For they have their only happiness down here.
        <span className="sup">25</span>They are fat and prosperous now, but a
        time of awful hunger is before them. Their careless laughter now means
        sorrow then. <span className="sup">26</span>And what sadness is ahead
        for those praised by the crowds--for <em>false</em> prophets have
        <em>always</em> been praised.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Listen, all of you. Love your
        <em>enemies.</em> Do <em>good</em> to those who <em>hate</em> you.
        <span className="sup">28</span>Pray for the happiness of those who
        <em>curse</em> you; implore God's blessing on those who
        <em>hurt</em> you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"If someone slaps you on one cheek, let
        him slap the other too! If someone demands your coat, give him your
        shirt besides. <span className="sup">30</span>Give what you have to
        anyone who asks you for it; and when things are taken away from you,
        don't worry about getting them back. <span className="sup">31</span>
        Treat others as you want them to treat you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"Do you think you deserve credit for
        merely loving those who love you? Even the godless do that!
        <span className="sup">33</span>And if you do good only to those who do
        you good--is that so wonderful? Even sinners do that much!
        <span className="sup">34</span>And if you lend money only to those who
        can repay you, what good is that? Even the most wicked will lend to
        their own kind for full return!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>"Love your <em>enemies!</em> Do good to
        <em>them!</em> Lend to <em>them!</em> And don't be concerned about the
        fact that they won't repay. Then your reward from heaven will be very
        great, and you will truly be acting as sons of God: for he is kind to
        the <em>unthankful</em> and to those who are <em>very wicked.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"Try to show as much compassion as your
        Father does. <span className="sup">37</span>Never criticize or
        condemn--or it will all come back on you. Go easy on others; then they
        will do the same for you. <span className="sup">38</span>For if you
        give, you will get! Your gift will return to you in full and overflowing
        measure, pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, and
        running over. Whatever measure you use to give--large or small--will be
        used to measure what is given back to you."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">39</span>Here are some of the
          story-illustrations Jesus used in his sermons:
        </span>
        "What good is it for one blind man to lead another? He will fall into a
        ditch and pull the other down with him. <span className="sup">40</span>
        How can a student know more than his teacher? But if he works hard, he
        may learn as much.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>"And why quibble about the speck in
        someone else's eye--his little fault--when a board is in your own?
        <span className="sup">42</span>How can you think of saying to him,
        'Brother, let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you
        can't see past the board in yours? Hypocrite! First get rid of the
        board, and then perhaps you can see well enough to deal with his speck!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"A tree from good stock doesn't produce
        scrub fruit nor do trees from poor stock produce choice fruit.
        <span className="sup">44</span>A tree is identified by the kind of fruit
        it produces. Figs never grow on thorns, or grapes on bramble bushes.
        <span className="sup">45</span>A good man produces good deeds from a
        good heart. And an evil man produces evil deeds from his hidden
        wickedness. Whatever is in the heart overflows into speech.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>"So why do you call me 'Lord' when you
        won't obey me? <span className="sup">47,48</span>But all those who come
        and listen and obey me are like a man who builds a house on a strong
        foundation laid upon the underlying rock. When the floodwaters rise and
        break against the house, it stands firm, for it is strongly built.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>"But those who listen and don't obey are
        like a man who builds a house without a foundation. When the floods
        sweep down against that house, it crumbles into a heap of ruins."
