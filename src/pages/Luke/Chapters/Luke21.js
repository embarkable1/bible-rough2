        As he stood in the Temple, he was watching the rich tossing their gifts
        into the collection box. <span className="sup">2</span>Then a poor widow
        came by and dropped in two small copper coins.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"Really," <span>he remarked, </span>"this
        poor widow has given more than all the rest of them combined.
        <span className="sup">4</span>For they have given a little of what they
        didn't need, but she, poor as she is, has given every thing she has."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Some of his disciples began talking about
        the beautiful stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on
        the walls.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">5</span>But Jesus said,{' '}
        </span>
        "The time is coming when all these things you are admiring will be
        knocked down, and not one stone will be left on top of another; all will
        become one vast heap of rubble."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Master!" they exclaimed. "When? And will
        there be any warning ahead of time?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't let anyone mislead you. For many will come announcing
          themselves as the Messiah, and saying, 'The time has come.' But don't
          believe them! <span className="sup">9</span>And when you hear of wars
          and insurrections beginning, don't panic. True, wars must come, but
          the end won't follow immediately-- <span className="sup">10</span>for
          nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom,
          <span className="sup">11</span>and there will be great earthquakes,
          and famines in many lands, and epidemics, and terrifying things
          happening in the heavens.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"But before all this occurs, there will
        be a time of special persecution, and you will be dragged into
        synagogues and prisons and before kings and governors for my Name's
        sake.
        <span className="sup">13</span>But as a result, the Messiah will be
        widely known and honored. <span className="sup">14</span>Therefore,
        don't be concerned about how to answer the charges against you,
        <span className="sup">15</span>for I will give you the right words and
        such logic that none of your opponents will be able to reply!
        <span className="sup">16</span>Even those closest to you--your parents,
        brothers, relatives, and friends will betray you and have you arrested;
        and some of you will be killed. <span className="sup">17</span>And
        everyone will hate you because you are mine and are called by my Name.
        <span className="sup">18</span>But not a hair of your head will perish!
        <span className="sup">19</span>For if you stand firm, you will win your
        souls.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by
        armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived.
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then let the people of Judea flee to the
        hills. Let those in Jerusalem try to escape, and those outside the city
        must not attempt to return. <span className="sup">22</span>For those
        will be days of God's judgment, and the words of the ancient Scriptures
        written by the prophets will be abundantly fulfilled.
        <span className="sup">23</span>Woe to expectant mothers in those days,
        and those with tiny babies. For there will be great distress upon this
        nation and wrath upon this people. <span className="sup">24</span>They
        will be brutally killed by enemy weapons, or sent away as exiles and
        captives to all the nations of the world; and Jerusalem shall be
        conquered and trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of Gentile
        triumph ends in God's good time.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Then there will be strange events in the
        skies--warnings, evil omens and portents in the sun, moon and stars; and
        down here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the
        roaring seas and strange tides. <span className="sup">26</span>The
        courage of many people will falter because of the fearful fate they see
        coming upon the earth, for the stability of the very heavens will be
        broken up.
        <span className="sup">27</span>Then the peoples of earth shall see me,
        the Messiah, coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
        <span className="sup">28</span>So when all these things begin to happen,
        stand straight and look up! For your salvation is near."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">29</span>Then he gave them this illustration:
        </span>
        "Notice the fig tree, or any other tree. <span className="sup">30</span>
        When the leaves come out, you know without being told that summer is
        near.
        <span className="sup">31</span>In the same way, when you see the events
        taking place that I've described you can be just as sure that the
        Kingdom of God is near.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"I solemnly declare to you that when
        these things happen, the end of this age has come.
        <span className="sup">33</span>And though all heaven and earth shall
        pass away, yet my words remain forever true."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34,35</span>"Watch out! Don't let my sudden coming
        catch you unawares; don't let me find you living in careless ease,
        carousing and drinking, and occupied with the problems of this life,
        like all the rest of the world. <span className="sup">36</span>Keep a
        constant watch. And pray that if possible you may arrive in my presence
        without having to experience these horrors."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>Every day Jesus went to the Temple to
        teach, and the crowds began gathering early in the morning to hear him.
        And each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.
