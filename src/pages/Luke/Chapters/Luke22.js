      <h3>Chapter 22</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        And now the Passover celebration was drawing near--the Jewish festival
        when only bread made without yeast was used.
        <span className="sup">2</span>The chief priests and other religious
        leaders were actively plotting Jesus' murder, trying to find a way to
        kill him without starting a riot--a possibility they greatly feared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot,
        who was one of the twelve disciples, <span className="sup">4</span>and
        he went over to the chief priests and captains of the Temple guards to
        discuss the best way to betray Jesus to them.{' '}
        <span className="sup">5</span>They were, of course, delighted to know
        that he was ready to help them and promised him a reward.{' '}
        <span className="sup">6</span>So he began to look for an opportunity for
        them to arrest Jesus quietly when the crowds weren't around.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Now the day of the Passover celebration
        arrived, when the Passover lamb was killed and eaten with the unleavened
        bread. <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus sent Peter and John ahead to
        find a place to prepare their Passover meal.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"Where do you want us to go?" they asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>And he replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "As soon as you enter Jerusalem, you will see a man walking along
          carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house he enters,
          <span className="sup">11</span>and say to the man who lives there,
          'Our Teacher says for you to show us the guest room where he can eat
          the Passover meal with his disciples.' <span className="sup">12</span>
          He will take you upstairs to a large room all ready for us. That is
          the place. Go ahead and prepare the meal there."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>They went off to the city and found
        everything just as Jesus said, and prepared the Passover supper.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then Jesus and the others arrived, and at
        the proper time all sat down together at the table;
        <span className="sup">15</span>and he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I have looked forward to this hour with deep longing, anxious to eat
          this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins.
          <span className="sup">16</span>For I tell you now that I won't eat it
          again until what it represents has occurred in the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Then he took a glass of wine, and when he
        had given thanks for it, he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Take this and share it among yourselves.
          <span className="sup">18</span>For I will not drink wine again until
          the Kingdom of God has come."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Then he took a loaf of bread; and when he
        had thanked God for it, he broke it apart and gave it to them, saying,
        <span class="jesus">
          "This is my body, given for you. Eat it in remembrance of me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>After supper he gave them another glass
        of wine, saying,
        <span class="jesus">
          "This wine is the token of God's new agreement to save you--an
          agreement sealed with the blood I shall pour out to purchase back your
          souls. <span className="sup">21</span>But here at this table, sitting
          among us as a friend, is the man who will betray me.
          <span className="sup">22</span>I must die. It is part of God's plan.
          But, oh, the horror awaiting that man who betrays me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then the disciples wondered among
        themselves which of them would ever do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>And they began to argue among themselves
        as to who would have the highest rank [in the coming Kingdom].
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Jesus told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "In this world the kings and great men order their slaves around, and
          the slaves have no choice but to like it!
          <span className="sup">26</span>But among you, the one who serves you
          best will be your leader. <span className="sup">27</span>Out in the
          world the master sits at the table and is served by his servants. But
          not here! For I am your servant. <span className="sup">28</span>
          Nevertheless, because you have stood true to me in these terrible
          days,
          <span className="sup">29</span>and because my Father has granted me a
          Kingdom, I, here and now, grant you the right
          <span className="sup">30</span>to eat and drink at my table in that
          Kingdom; and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of
          Israel.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to have
        you, to sift you like wheat, <span className="sup">32</span>but I have
        pleaded in prayer for you that your faith should not completely fail. So
        when you have repented and turned to me again, strengthen and build up
        the faith of your brothers."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Simon said, "Lord, I am ready to go to
        jail with you, and even to die with you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Peter, let me tell you something. Between now and tomorrow morning
          when the rooster crows, you will deny me three times, declaring that
          you don't even know me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Then Jesus asked them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When I sent you out to preach the Good News and you were without
          money, duffle bag, or extra clothing, how did you get along?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"Fine," they replied.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"But now," <span>he said,</span> "take a
        duffle bag if you have one, and your money. And if you don't have a
        sword, better sell your clothes and buy one!
        <span className="sup">37</span>For the time has come for this prophecy
        about me to come true: 'He will be condemned as a criminal!' Yes,
        everything written about me by the prophets will come true."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"Master," they replied, "we have two
        swords among us."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Enough!"</span> he said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Then, accompanied by the disciples, he
        left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives.
        <span className="sup">40</span>There he told them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Pray God that you will not be overcome by temptation."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41,42</span>He walked away, perhaps a stone's
        throw, and knelt down and prayed this prayer:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Father, if you are willing, please take away this cup of horror from
          me. But I want your will, not mine."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">43</span>Then an angel from heaven appeared and
        strengthened him, <span className="sup">44</span>for he was in such
        agony of spirit that he broke into a sweat of blood, with great drops
        falling to the ground as he prayed more and more earnestly.
        <span className="sup">45</span>At last he stood up again and returned to
        the disciples--only to find them asleep, exhausted from grief.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Asleep!" <span>he said. </span>"Get up! Pray God that you will not
          fall when you are tempted."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>But even as he said this, a mob
        approached, led by Judas, one of his twelve disciples. Judas walked over
        to Jesus and kissed him on the cheek in friendly greeting.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Judas, how can you do this--betray the Messiah with a kiss?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>When the other disciples saw what was
        about to happen, they exclaimed, "Master, shall we fight? We brought
        along the swords!" <span className="sup">50</span>And one of them
        slashed at the High Priest's servant, and cut off his right ear.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">"Don't resist any more."</span> And he touched the
        place where the man's ear had been and restored it.
        <span className="sup">52</span>Then Jesus addressed the chief priests
        and captains of the Temple guards and the religious leaders who headed
        the mob.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Am I a robber," <span>he asked, </span>"that you have come armed with
          swords and clubs to get me? <span className="sup">53</span>Why didn't
          you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your
          moment--the time when Satan's power reigns supreme."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>So they seized him and led him to the
        High Priest's residence, and Peter followed at a distance.
        <span className="sup">55</span>The soldiers lit a fire in the courtyard
        and sat around it for warmth, and Peter joined them there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">56</span>A servant girl noticed him in the
        firelight and began staring at him. Finally she spoke: "This man was
        with Jesus!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>Peter denied it. "Woman," he said, "I
        don't even know the man!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">58</span>After a while someone else looked at him
        and said, "You must be one of them!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"No sir, I am not!" Peter replied.</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>About an hour later someone else flatly
        stated, "I know this fellow is one of Jesus' disciples, for both are
        from Galilee."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what
        you are talking about." And as he said the words, a rooster crowed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>At that moment Jesus turned and looked at
        Peter. Then Peter remembered what he had said--"Before the rooster crows
        tomorrow morning, you will deny me three times."
        <span className="sup">62</span>And Peter walked out of the courtyard,
        crying bitterly.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">63,64</span>Now the guards in charge of Jesus
        began mocking him. They blindfolded him and hit him with their fists and
        asked, "Who hit you that time, prophet?" <span className="sup">65</span>
        And they threw all sorts of other insults at him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">66</span>Early the next morning at daybreak the
        Jewish Supreme Court assembled, including the chief priests and all the
        top religious authorities of the nation. Jesus was led before the
        Council,
        <span className="sup">67,68</span>and instructed to state whether or not
        he claimed to be the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        But he replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If I tell you, you won't believe me or let me present my case.
          <span className="sup">69</span>But the time is soon coming when I, the

        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">70</span>They all shouted, "Then you claim you are
        the Son of God?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And he replied, <span class="jesus">"Yes, I am."</span>

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">71</span>"What need do we have for other
