      <h3>Chapter 8</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Not long afterwards he began a tour of the cities and villages of
        Galilee to announce the coming of the Kingdom of God, and took his
        twelve disciples with him. <span className="sup">2</span>Some women went
        along, from whom he had cast out demons or whom he had healed; among
        them were Mary Magdalene (Jesus had cast out seven demons from her),
        <span className="sup">3</span>Joanna, Chuza's wife (Chuza was King
        Herod's business manager and was in charge of his palace and domestic
        affairs), Susanna, and many others who were contributing from their
        private means to the support of Jesus and his disciples.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>One day he gave this illustration to a
        large crowd that was gathering to hear him--while many others were still
        on the way, coming from other towns.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"A farmer went out to his field to sow
        grain. As he scattered the seed on the ground, some of it fell on a
        footpath and was trampled on; and the birds came and ate it as it lay
        exposed.
        <span className="sup">6</span>Other seed fell on shallow soil with rock
        beneath. This seed began to grow, but soon withered and died for lack of
        moisture. <span className="sup">7</span>Other seed landed in thistle
        patches, and the young grain stalks were soon choked out.
        <span className="sup">8</span>Still other fell on fertile soil; this
        seed grew and produced a crop one hundred times as large as he had
        planted."
        <span>(As he was giving this illustration he said, </span>"If anyone has
        listening ears, use them now!")
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>His apostles asked him what the story
        meant.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "God has granted you to know the meaning of these parables, for they
          tell a great deal about the Kingdom of God. But these crowds hear the
          words and do not understand, just as the ancient prophets predicted."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"This is its meaning: The seed is God's
        message to men. <span className="sup">12</span>The hard path where some
        seed fell represents the hard hearts of those who hear the words of God,
        but then the devil comes and steals the words away and prevents people
        from believing and being saved. <span className="sup">13</span>The stony
        ground represents those who enjoy listening to sermons, but somehow the
        message never really gets through to them and doesn't take root and
        grow. They know the message is true, and sort of believe for awhile; but
        when the hot winds of persecution blow, they lose interest.
        <span className="sup">14</span>The seed among the thorns represents
        those who listen and believe God's words but whose faith afterwards is
        choked out by worry and riches and the responsibilities and pleasures of
        life. And so they are never able to help anyone else to believe the Good
        News.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"But the good soil represents honest,
        good-hearted people. They listen to God's words and cling to them and
        steadily spread them to others who also soon believe."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">16</span>[Another time he asked,]
        </span>{' '}
        "Who ever heard of someone lighting a lamp and then covering it up to
        keep it from shining? No, lamps are mounted in the open where they can
        be seen.
        <span className="sup">17</span>This illustrates the fact that someday
        everything [in men's hearts] shall be brought to light and made plain to
        all. <span className="sup">18</span>So be careful how you listen; for
        whoever has, to him shall be given more; and whoever does not have, even
        what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Once when his mother and brothers came to
        see him, they couldn't get into the house where he was teaching, because
        of the crowds. <span className="sup">20</span>When Jesus heard they were
        standing outside and wanted to see him, <span className="sup">21</span>
        he remarked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "My mother and my brothers are all those who hear the message of God
          and obey it."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>One day about that time, as he and his
        disciples were out in a boat, he suggested that they cross to the other
        side of the lake. <span className="sup">23</span>On the way across he
        lay down for a nap, and while he was sleeping the wind began to rise. A
        fierce storm developed that threatened to swamp them, and they were in
        real danger.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>They rushed over and woke him up.
        "Master, Master, we are sinking!" they screamed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        So he spoke to the storm: <span class="jesus">"Quiet down,"</span> he
        said, and the wind and waves subsided and all was calm!
        <span className="sup">25</span>Then he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Where is your faith?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And they were filled with awe and fear of him and said to one another,
        "Who is this man, that even the winds and waves obey him?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>So they arrived at the other side, in the
        Gerasene country across the lake from Galilee.
        <span className="sup">27</span>As he was climbing out of the boat a man
        from the city of Gadara came to meet him, a man who had been
        demon-possessed for a long time. Homeless and naked, he lived in a
        cemetery among the tombs. <span className="sup">28</span>As soon as he
        saw Jesus he shrieked and fell to the ground before him, screaming,
        "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? Please, I beg
        you, oh, don't torment me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>For Jesus was already commanding the
        demon to leave him. This demon had often taken control of the man so
        that even when shackled with chains he simply broke them and rushed out
        into the desert, completely under the demon's power.{' '}
        <span className="sup">30</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What is your name?"</span> Jesus asked the demon.
        "Legion," they replied--for the man was filled with thousands of them!
        <span className="sup">31</span>They kept begging Jesus not to order them
        into the Bottomless Pit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>A herd of pigs was feeding on the
        mountainside nearby, and the demons pled with him to let them enter into
        the pigs. And Jesus said they could. <span className="sup">33</span>So
        they left the man and went into the pigs, and immediately the whole herd
        rushed down the mountainside and fell over a cliff into the lake below,
        where they drowned. <span className="sup">34</span>The herdsmen rushed
        away to the nearby city, spreading the news as they ran.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Soon a crowd came out to see for
        themselves what had happened and saw the man who had been
        demon-possessed sitting quietly at Jesus' feet, clothed and sane! And
        the whole crowd was badly frightened. <span className="sup">36</span>
        Then those who had seen it happen told how the demon-possessed man had
        been healed.
        <span className="sup">37</span>And everyone begged Jesus to go away and
        leave them alone (for a deep wave of fear had swept over them). So he
        returned to the boat and left, crossing back to the other side of the
        lake.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>The man who had been demon-possessed
        begged to go too, but Jesus said no.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Go back to your family,"
        <span>he told him, </span>"and tell them what a wonderful thing God has
        done for you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        So he went all through the city telling everyone about Jesus' mighty
        miracle.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>On the other side of the lake the crowds
        received him with open arms, for they had been waiting for him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>And now a man named Jairus, a leader of a
        Jewish synagogue, came and fell down at Jesus' feet and begged him to
        come home with him, <span className="sup">42</span>for his only child
        was dying, a little girl twelve years old. Jesus went with him, pushing
        through the crowds.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43,44</span>As they went a woman who wanted to be
        healed came up behind and touched him, for she had been slowly bleeding
        for twelve years, and could find no cure (though she had spent
        everything she had on doctors). But the instant she touched the edge of
        his robe, the bleeding stopped.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>
        <span class="jesus">"Who touched me?"</span> Jesus asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Everyone denied it, and Peter said, "Master, so many are crowding
        against you . . . ."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>But Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "No, it was someone who deliberately touched me, for I felt healing
          power go out from me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>When the woman realized that Jesus knew,
        she began to tremble and fell to her knees before him and told why she
        had touched him and that now she was well.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Daughter," <span>he said to her,</span> "your faith has healed you.
          Go in peace."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>While he was still speaking to her, a
        messenger arrived from the Jairus' home with the news that the little
        girl was dead. "She's gone," he told her father; "there's no use
        troubling the Teacher now."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>But when Jesus heard what had happened,
        he said to the father,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't be afraid! Just trust me, and she'll be all right."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>When they arrived at the house Jesus
        wouldn't let anyone into the room except Peter, James, John, and the

        was filled with mourning people, but he said,

          "Stop the weeping! She isn't dead; she is only asleep!"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">53</span>This brought scoffing and laughter, for
        they all knew she was dead.

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>Then he took her by the hand and called,

        <span className="sup">55</span>And at that moment her life returned and
        she jumped up! <span class="jesus">"Give her something to eat!"</span>{' '}
        he said. <span className="sup">56</span>Her parents were overcome with
