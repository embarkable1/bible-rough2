      <h3>Chapter 13</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        About this time he was informed that Pilate had butchered some Jews from
        Galilee as they were sacrificing at the Temple in Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"Do you think they were worse sinners than
        other men from Galilee?" <span>he asked. </span>"Is that why they
        suffered? <span className="sup">3</span>Not at all! And don't you
        realize that you also will perish unless you leave your evil ways and
        turn to God?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"And what about the eighteen men who died
        when the Tower of Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in
        Jerusalem? <span className="sup">5</span>Not at all! And you, too, will
        perish unless you repent."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">6</span>Then he used this illustration:
        </span>
        "A man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see
        if he could find any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed.
        <span className="sup">7</span>Finally he told his gardener to cut it
        down. 'I've waited three years and there hasn't been a single fig!' he
        said. 'Why bother with it any longer? It's taking up space we can use
        for something else.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"'Give it one more chance,' the gardener
        answered. 'Leave it another year, and I'll give it special attention and
        plenty of fertilizer. <span className="sup">9</span>If we get figs next
        year, fine; if not, I'll cut it down."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>One Sabbath as he was teaching in a
        synagogue, <span className="sup">11</span>he saw a seriously handicapped
        woman who had been bent double for eighteen years and was unable to
        straighten herself.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Calling her over to him Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">"Woman, you are healed of your sickness!"</span>
        <span className="sup">13</span>He touched her, and instantly she could
        stand straight. How she praised and thanked God!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>But the local Jewish leader in charge of
        the synagogue was very angry about it because Jesus had healed her on
        the Sabbath day. "There are six days of the week to work," he shouted to
        the crowd. "Those are the days to come for healing, not on the Sabbath!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>But the Lord replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You hypocrite! You work on the Sabbath! Don't you untie your cattle
          from their stalls on the Sabbath and lead them out for water?
          <span className="sup">16</span>And is it wrong for me, just because it
          is the Sabbath day, to free this Jewish woman from the bondage in
          which Satan has held her for eighteen years?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>This shamed his enemies. And all the
        people rejoiced at the wonderful things he did.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Now he began teaching them about the
        Kingdom of God:
        <span class="jesus">
          "What is the Kingdom like?" <span>he asked. </span>"How can I
          illustrate it? <span className="sup">19</span>It is like a tiny
          mustard seed planted in a garden; soon it grows into a tall bush, and
          the birds live among its branches. <span className="sup">20,21</span>
          It is like yeast kneaded into dough, which works unseen until it has
          risen high and light."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>He went from city to city and village to
        village, teaching as he went, always pressing onward toward Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Someone asked him, "Will only a few be
        saved?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And he replied, <span className="sup">24,25</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "The door to heaven is narrow. Work hard to get in, for the truth is
          that many will try to enter but when the head of the house has locked
          the door, it will be too late. Then if you stand outside knocking, and
          pleading, 'Lord, open the door for us,' he will reply, 'I do not know
          you.'
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"'But we ate with you, and you taught in
        our streets,' you will say.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"And he will reply, 'I tell you, I don't
        know you. You can't come in here, guilty as you are. Go away.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"And there will be great weeping and
        gnashing of teeth as you stand outside and see Abraham, Isaac, and
        Jacob, and all the prophets within the Kingdom of God--{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>for people will come from all over the
        world to take their places there.
        <span className="sup">30</span>And note this: some who are despised now
        will be greatly honored then; and some who are highly thought of now
        will be least important then."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>A few minutes later some Pharisees said
        to him, "Get out of here if you want to live, for King Herod is after
        you!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">32</span>Jesus replied,{' '}
        </span>
        "Go tell that fox that I will keep on casting out demons and doing
        miracles of healing today and tomorrow; and the third day I will reach
        my destination.
        <span className="sup">33</span>Yes, today, tomorrow, and the next day!
        For it wouldn't do for a prophet of God to be killed except in
        Jerusalem!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! The city that
        murders the prophets. The city that stones those sent to help her. How
        often I have wanted to gather your children together even as a hen
        protects her brood under her wings, but you wouldn't let me.
        <span className="sup">35</span>And now--now your house is left desolate.
        And you will never again see me until you say, 'Welcome to him who comes
        in the name of the Lord.'"
