      <h3>Chapter 11</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Once when Jesus had been out praying, one of his disciples came to him
        as he finished and said, "Lord, teach us a prayer to recite just as John
        taught one to his disciples."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>And this is the prayer he taught them:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Father, may your name be honored for its holiness; send your Kingdom
          soon. <span className="sup">3</span>Give us our food day by day.
          <span className="sup">4</span>And forgive our sins--for we have
          forgiven those who sinned against us. And don't allow us to be
          tempted."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>Then, teaching them more about prayer,
        he used this illustration:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Suppose you went to friend's house at midnight, wanting to borrow
          three loaves of bread. You would shout up to him, 'A friend of mine
          has just arrived for a visit and I've nothing to give him to eat.'
          <span className="sup">7</span>He would call down from his bedroom,
          'Please don't ask me to get up. The door is locked for the night and
          we are all in bed. I just can't help you this time.'
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"But I'll tell you this--though he won't
        do it as a friend, if you keep knocking long enough he will get up and
        give you everything you want--just because of your persistence.
        <span className="sup">9</span>And so it is with prayer--keep on asking
        and you will keep on getting; keep on looking and you will keep on
        finding; knock and the door will be opened.{' '}
        <span className="sup">10</span>Everyone who asks, receives; all who
        seek, find; and the door is opened to everyone who knocks.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"You men who are fathers--if your boy
        asks for bread, do you give him a stone? If he asks for fish, do you
        give him a snake? <span className="sup">12</span>If he asks for an egg,
        do you give him a scorpion? [Of course not!]
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"And if even sinful persons like
        yourselves give children what they need, don't you realize that your
        heavenly Father will do at least as much, and give the Holy Spirit to
        those who ask for him?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Once, when Jesus cast out a demon from a
        man who couldn't speak, his voice returned to him. The crowd was excited
        and enthusiastic, <span className="sup">15</span>but some said, "No
        wonder he can cast them out. He gets his power from Satan, the king of
        demons!"
        <span className="sup">16</span>Others asked for something to happen in
        the sky to prove his claim of being the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>He knew the thoughts of each of them, so
        he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Any kingdom filled with civil war is doomed; so is a home filled with
          argument and strife. <span className="sup">18</span>Therefore, if what
          you say is true, that Satan is fighting against himself by empowering
          me to cast out his demons, how can his kingdom survive?
          <span className="sup">19</span>And if I am empowered by Satan, what
          about your own followers? For they cast out demons! Do you think this
          proves they are possessed by Satan? Ask <em>them</em> if you are
          right!
          <span className="sup">20</span>But if I am casting out demons because
          of power from God, it proves that the Kingdom of God has arrived.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"For when Satan, strong and fully armed,
        guards his palace, it is safe-- <span className="sup">22</span>until
        someone stronger and better-armed attacks and overcomes him and strips
        him of his weapons and carries off his belongings.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"Anyone who is not for me is against me;
        if he isn't helping me, he is hurting my cause.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"When a demon is cast out of a man, it
        goes to the deserts, searching there for rest; but finding none, it
        returns to the person it left, <span className="sup">25</span>and finds
        that its former home is all swept and clean.{' '}
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then it goes and gets seven other demons
        more evil than itself, and they all enter the man. And so the poor
        fellow is seven times worse off than he was before."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd
        called out, "God bless your mother--the womb from which you came, and
        the breasts that gave you suck!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes, but even more blessed are all who hear the Word of God and put
          it into practice."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30</span>As the crowd pressed in upon him, he
        preached them this sermon:
        <span class="jesus">
          "These are evil times, with evil people. They keep asking for some
          strange happening in the skies [to prove that I am the Messiah], but
          the only proof I will give them is a miracle like that of Jonah, whose
          experiences proved to people of Nineveh that God had sent him. My
          similar experience will prove that God has sent me to these people.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"And at the Judgment Day the Queen of
        Sheba shall arise and point her finger at this generation, condemning
        it, for she went on a long, hard journey to listen to the wisdom of
        Solomon; but one far greater than Solomon is here [and few pay any
        attention].
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"The men of Nineveh, too, shall arise and
        condemn this nation, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and
        someone far greater than Jonah is here [but this nation won't listen].
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"No one lights a lamp and hides it!
        Instead, he puts it on a lampstand to give light to all who enter the
        room.
        <span className="sup">34</span>Your eyes light up your inward being. A
        pure eye lets sunshine into your soul. A lustful eye shuts out the light
        and plunges you into darkness. <span className="sup">35</span>So watch
        out that the sunshine isn't blotted out. <span className="sup">36</span>
        If you are filled with light within, with no dark corners, then your
        face will be radiant too, as though a floodlight is beamed upon you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>As he was speaking, one of the
        Pharisees asked him home for a meal. When Jesus arrived, he sat down to
        eat without first performing the ceremonial washing required by Jewish
        custom. This greatly surprised his host.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Then Jesus said to him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You Pharisees wash the outside, but inside you are still dirty--full
          of greed and wickedness! <span className="sup">40</span>Fools! Didn't
          God make the inside as well as the outside?
          <span className="sup">41</span>Purity is best demonstrated by
          generosity.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "But woe to you Pharisees! For though you are careful to tithe even
          the smallest part of your income, you completely forget about justice
          and the love of God. You should tithe, yes, but you should not leave
          these other things undone.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Woe to you Pharisees! For how you love the seats of honor in the
          synagogues and the respectful greetings from everyone as you walk
          through the markets! <span className="sup">44</span>Yes, awesome
          judgment is awaiting you. For you are like hidden graves in a field.
          Men go by you with no knowledge of the corruption they are passing."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>"Sir," said an expert in religious law
        who was standing there, "you have insulted my profession, too, in what
        you just said."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>"Yes," <span>said Jesus, </span>"the same
        horrors await you! For you crush men beneath impossible religious
        demands--demands that you yourselves would never think of trying to
        keep. <span className="sup">47</span>Woe to you! For you are exactly
        like your ancestors who killed the prophets long ago.
        <span className="sup">48</span>Murderers! You agree with your fathers
        that what they did was right--you would have done the same yourselves.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>"This is what God says about you: 'I will
        send prophets and apostles to you, and you will kill some of them and
        chase away the others.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>"And you of this generation will be held
        responsible for the murder of God's servants from the founding of the
        world-- <span className="sup">51</span>from the murder of Abel to the
        murder of Zechariah who perished between the altar and the sanctuary.
        Yes, it will surely be charged against you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>"Woe to you experts in religion! For you
        hide the truth from the people. You won't accept it for yourselves, and
        you prevent others from having a chance to believe it."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">53,54</span>The Pharisees and legal experts were
        furious; and from that time on they plied him fiercely with a host of
        questions, trying to trap him into saying something for which they could
        have him arrested.
