      <h3>Chapter 15</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Dishonest tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to
        listen to Jesus' sermons; <span className="sup">2</span>but this caused
        complaints from the Jewish religious leaders and the experts on Jewish
        law because he was associating with such despicable people--even eating
        with them! <span className="sup">3,4</span>So Jesus used this
        illustration:
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you had a hundred sheep and one of them strayed away and was lost
          in the wilderness, wouldn't you leave the ninety-nine others to go and
          search for the lost one until you found it?
          <span className="sup">5</span>And then you would joyfully carry it
          home on your shoulders. <span className="sup">6</span>When you arrived
          you would call together your friends and neighbors to rejoice with you
          because your lost sheep was found.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"Well, in the same way heaven will be
        happier over one lost sinner who returns to God than over ninety-nine
        others who haven't strayed away!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"Or take another illustration: A woman has
        ten valuable silver coins and loses one. Won't she light a lamp and look
        in every corner of the house and sweep every nook and cranny until she
        finds it? <span className="sup">9</span>And then won't she call in her
        friends and neighbors to rejoice with her?{' '}
        <span className="sup">10</span>In the same way there is joy in the
        presence of the angels of God when one sinner repents."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        To further illustrate the point, he told them this story:
        <span className="sup">11</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "A man had two sons. <span className="sup">12</span>When the younger
          told his father, 'I want my share of your estate now, instead of
          waiting until you die!' his father agreed to divide his wealth between
          his sons.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"A few days later this younger son packed
        all his belongings and took a trip to a distant land, and there wasted
        all his money on parties and prostitutes.{' '}
        <span className="sup">14</span>About the time his money was gone a great
        famine swept over the land, and he began to starve.{' '}
        <span className="sup">15</span>He persuaded a local farmer to hire him
        to feed his pigs. <span className="sup">16</span>The boy became so
        hungry that even the pods he was feeding the swine looked good to him.
        And no one gave him anything.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"When he finally came to his senses, he
        said to himself, 'At home even the hired men have food enough and to
        spare, and here I am, dying of hunger! <span className="sup">18</span>I
        will go home to my father and say, "Father, I have sinned against both
        heaven and you, <span className="sup">19</span>and am no longer worthy
        of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired man."'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"So he returned home to his father. And
        while he was still a long distance away, his father saw him coming, and
        was filled with loving pity and ran and embraced him and kissed him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"His son said to him, 'Father, I have
        sinned against heaven and you, and am not worthy of being called your
        son--'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"But his father said to the slaves,
        'Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. And a
        jeweled ring for his finger; and shoes! <span className="sup">23</span>
        And kill the calf we have in the fattening pen. We must celebrate with a
        feast,
        <span className="sup">24</span>for this son of mine was dead and has
        returned to life. He was lost and is found.' So the party began.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"Meanwhile, the older son was in the
        fields working; when he returned home, he heard dance music coming from
        the house, <span className="sup">26</span>and he asked one of the
        servants what was going on.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"'Your brother is back,' he was told,
        'and your father has killed the calf we were fattening and has prepared
        a great feast to celebrate his coming home again unharmed.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"The older brother was angry and wouldn't
        go in. His father came out and begged him,{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>but he replied, 'All these years I've
        worked hard for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told
        me to; and in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a
        feast with my friends.
        <span className="sup">30</span>Yet when this son of yours comes back
        after spending your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the
        finest calf we have on the place.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"'Look, dear son,' his father said to
        him, 'you and I are very close, and everything I have is yours.
        <span className="sup">31</span>But it is right to celebrate. For he is
        your brother; and he was dead and has come back to life! He was lost and
        is found!'"
      </p>
    </>
