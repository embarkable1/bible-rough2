      <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Dear friend who loves God: <span className="sup">1,2</span>Several
        biographies of Christ have already been written using as their source
        material the reports circulating among us from the early disciples and
        other eyewitnesses. <span className="sup">3</span>However, it occurred
        to me that it would be well to recheck all these accounts from first to
        last and after thorough investigation to pass this summary on to you,
        <span className="sup">4</span>to reassure you of the truth of all you
        were taught.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>My story begins with a Jewish priest,
        Zacharias, who lived when Herod was king of Judea. Zacharias was a
        member of the Abijah division of the Temple service corps. (His wife
        Elizabeth was, like himself, a member of the priest tribe of the Jews, a
        descendant of Aaron.) <span className="sup">6</span>Zacharias and
        Elizabeth were godly folk, careful to obey all of God's laws in spirit
        as well as in letter. <span className="sup">7</span>But they had no
        children, for Elizabeth was barren; and now they were both very old.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8,9</span>One day as Zacharias was going about his
        work in the Temple--for his division was on duty that week--the honor
        fell to him by lot to enter the inner sanctuary and burn incense before
        the Lord. <span className="sup">10</span>Meanwhile, a great crowd stood
        outside in the Temple court, praying as they always did during that part
        of the service when the incense was being burned.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11,12</span>Zacharias was in the sanctuary when
        suddenly an angel appeared, standing to the right of the altar of
        incense! Zacharias was startled and terrified.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>But the angel said, "Don't be afraid,
        Zacharias! For I have come to tell you that God has heard your prayer,
        and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son! And you are to name him
        John. <span className="sup">14</span>You will both have great joy and
        gladness at his birth, and many will rejoice with you.
        <span className="sup">15</span>For he will be one of the Lord's great
        men. He must never touch wine or hard liquor--and he will be filled with
        the Holy Spirit, even from before his birth!{' '}
        <span className="sup">16</span>And he will persuade many a Jew to turn
        to the Lord his God.
        <span className="sup">17</span>He will be a man of rugged spirit and
        power like Elijah, the prophet of old; and he will precede the coming of
        the Messiah, preparing the people for his arrival. He will soften adult
        hearts to become like little children's, and will change disobedient
        minds to the wisdom of faith."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Zacharias said to the angel, "But this is
        impossible! I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in
        years."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I
        stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to you with
        this good news! <span className="sup">20</span>And now, because you
        haven't believed me, you are to be stricken silent, unable to speak
        until the child is born. For my words will certainly come true at the
        proper time."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Meanwhile the crowds outside were waiting
        for Zacharias to appear and wondered why he was taking so long.
        <span className="sup">22</span>When he finally came out, he couldn't
        speak to them, and they realized from his gestures that he must have
        seen a vision in the Temple. <span className="sup">23</span>He stayed on
        at the Temple for the remaining days of his Temple duties and then
        returned home. <span className="sup">24</span>Soon afterwards Elizabeth
        his wife became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"How kind the Lord is," she exclaimed,
        "to take away my disgrace of having no children!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Then following month God sent the angel
        Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,{' '}
        <span className="sup">27</span>to a virgin, Mary, engaged to be married
        to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Gabriel appeared to her and said,
        "Congratulations, favored lady! The Lord is with you!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to
        think what the angel could mean.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"Don't be frightened, Mary," the angel
        told her, "for God had decided to wonderfully bless you!
        <span className="sup">31</span>Very soon now, you will become pregnant
        and have a baby boy, and you are to name him 'Jesus.'
        <span className="sup">32</span>He shall be very great and shall be
        called the Son of God. And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his
        ancestor David. <span className="sup">33</span>And he shall reign over
        Israel forever; his Kingdom shall never end!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Mary asked the angel, "But how can I have
        a baby? I am a virgin."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit shall
        come upon you, and the power of God shall overshadow you; so the baby
        born to you will be utterly holy--the Son of God.
        <span className="sup">36</span>Furthermore, six months ago your Aunt
        Elizabeth--'the barren one,' they called her--became pregnant in her old
        age! <span className="sup">37</span>For every promise from God shall
        surely come true."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>Mary said, "I am the Lord's servant, and
        I am willing to do whatever he wants. May everything you said come
        true." And then the angel disappeared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39,40</span>A few days later Mary hurried to the
        highlands of Judea to the town where Zacharias lived, to visit
        Elizabeth.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>At the sound of Mary's greeting,
        Elizabeth's child leaped within her and she was filled with the Holy
        Spirit.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>She gave a glad cry and exclaimed to
        Mary, "You are the favored by God above all other women, and your child
        is destined for God's mightiest praise. <span className="sup">43</span>
        What an honor this is, that the mother of my Lord should visit me!
        <span className="sup">44</span>When you came in and greeted me, the
        instant I heard your voice, my baby moved in me for joy!
        <span className="sup">45</span>You believed that God would do what he
        said; that is why he has given you this wonderful blessing."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Mary responded, "Oh, how I praise the
        Lord.
        <span className="sup">47</span>How I rejoice in God my Savior!
        <span className="sup">48</span>For he took notice of his lowly servant
        girl, and now generation after generation forever shall call me blest of
        God.
        <span className="sup">49</span>For he, the mighty Holy One, has done
        great things to me. <span className="sup">50</span>His mercy goes on
        from generation to generation, to all who reverence him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>"How powerful is his mighty arm! How he
        scatters the proud and haughty ones! <span className="sup">52</span>He
        has torn princes from their thrones and exalted the lowly.
        <span className="sup">53</span>He has satisfied the hungry hearts and
        sent the rich away with empty hands. <span className="sup">54</span>And
        how he has helped his servant Israel! He has not forgotten his promise
        to be merciful. <span className="sup">55</span>For he promised our
        fathers--Abraham and his children--to be merciful to them forever."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">56</span>Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three
        months and then went back to her own home.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>By now Elizabeth's waiting was over, for
        the time had come for the baby to be born--and it was a boy.
        <span className="sup">58</span>The word spread quickly to her neighbors
        and relatives of how kind the Lord had been to her, and everyone
        rejoiced.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>When the baby was eight days old, all the
        relatives and friends came for the circumcision ceremony. They all
        assumed the baby's name would be Zacharias, after his father.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>But Elizabeth said, "No! He must be name
        John!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>"What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one
        in all your family by that name." <span className="sup">62</span>So they
        asked the baby's father, talking to him by gestures.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">63</span>He motioned for a piece of paper and to
        everyone's surprise wrote, "His name is <em>John!</em>"
        <span className="sup">64</span>Instantly Zacharias could speak again,
        and he began praising God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">65</span>Wonder fell upon the whole neighborhood,
        and the news of what had happened spread through the Judean hills.
        <span className="sup">66</span>And everyone who heard about it thought
        long thoughts and asked, "I wonder what this child will turn out to be?
        For the hand of the Lord is surely upon him in some special way."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">67</span>Then his father Zacharias was filled with
        the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">68</span>"Praise the Lord, God of Israel, for he
        has come to visit his people and has redeemed them.
        <span className="sup">69</span>He is sending us a Might Savior from the
        royal line of his servant David, <span className="sup">70</span>just as
        he promised through his holy prophets long ago--
        <span className="sup">71</span>someone to save us from our enemies, from
        all who hate us.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">72,73</span>"He has been merciful to our
        ancestors, yes, to Abraham himself, by remembering his sacred promise to
        him,
        <span className="sup">74</span>and by granting us the privilege of
        serving God fearlessly, freed from our enemies,{' '}
        <span className="sup">75</span>and by making us holy and acceptable,
        ready to stand in his presence forever.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">76</span>"And you, my little son, shall be called
        the prophet of the glorious God, for you will prepare the way for the
        Messiah. <span className="sup">77</span>You will tell his people how to
        find salvation through forgiveness of their sins.
        <span className="sup">78</span>All this will be because the mercy of our
        God is very tender, and heaven's dawn is about to break upon us,
        <span className="sup">79</span>to give light to those who sit in
        darkness and death's shadow, and to guide us to the path of peace."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">80</span>The little boy greatly loved God and when
        he grew up he lived out in the lonely wilderness until he began his
        public ministry to Israel.
