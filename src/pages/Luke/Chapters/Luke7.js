      <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        When Jesus had finished his sermon he went back into the city of
        Capernaum.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>Just at that time the highly prized slave
        of a Roman army captain was sick and near death.
        <span className="sup">3</span>When the captain heard about Jesus, he
        sent some respected Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his slave.
        <span className="sup">4</span>So they began pleading earnestly with
        Jesus to come with them and help the man. They told him what a wonderful
        person the captain was.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "If anyone deserves your help, it is he," they said,
        <span className="sup">5</span>"for he loves the Jews and even paid
        personally to build us a synagogue!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6,7,8</span>Jesus went with them; but just before
        arriving at the house, the captain sent some friends to say, "Sir, don't
        inconvenience yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of any
        such honor or even to come and meet you. Just speak a word from where
        you are, and my servant boy will be healed! I know, because I am under
        the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my men.
        I only need to say 'Go!' and they go; or 'Come!' and they come; and to
        my slave, 'Do this or that,' and he does it. So just say, 'Be healed!'
        and my servant will be well again!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Jesus was amazed. Turning to the crowd he
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Never among all the Jews in Israel have I met a man with faith like
          this."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>And when the captain's friends returned
        to his house, they found the slave completely healed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Not long afterwards Jesus went with his
        disciples to the village of Nain, with the usual great crowd at his
        heels. <span className="sup">12</span>A funeral procession was coming
        out as he approached the village gate. They boy who had died was the
        only son of his widowed mother, and many mourners from the village were
        with her.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>When the Lord saw her, his heart
        overflowed with sympathy.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't cry!"
          <span>
            he said. <span className="sup">14</span>Then he walked over to the
            coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped.
          </span>
          "Laddie," <span>he said,</span> "come back to life again."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then the boy sat up and began to talk to
        those around him! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>A great fear swept the crowd, and they
        exclaimed with praises to God, "A mighty prophet has risen among us,"
        and, "We have seen the hand of God at work today."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>The report of what he did that day raced
        from end to end of Judea and even out across the borders.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>The disciples of John the Baptist soon
        heard of all that Jesus was doing. When they told John about it,
        <span className="sup">19</span>he sent two of his disciples to Jesus to
        ask him, "Are you really the Messiah? Or shall we keep on looking for
        him?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20,21,22</span>The two disciples found Jesus while
        he was curing many sick people of their various diseases--healing the
        lame and the blind and casting out evil spirits. When they asked him
        John's question, this was his reply:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Go back to John and tell him all you have seen and heard here today:
          how those who were blind can see. The lame are walking without a limp.
          The lepers are completely healed. The deaf can hear again. The dead
          come back to life. And the poor are hearing the Good News.
          <span className="sup">23</span>And tell him, 'Blessed is the one who
          does not lose his faith in me.'"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>After they left, Jesus talked to the
        crowd about John.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Who is this man you went out into the Judean wilderness to see?"
          <span>he asked.</span> "Did you find him weak as grass, moved by every
          breath of wind? <span className="sup">25</span>Did you find him
          dressed in expensive clothes? No! Men who live in luxury are found in
          palaces, not out in the wilderness. <span className="sup">26</span>But
          did you find a prophet? Yes! And more than a prophet.{' '}
          <span className="sup">27</span>He is the one to whom the Scriptures
          refer when they say, 'Look! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, to
          prepare the way before you.'
          <span className="sup">28</span>In all humanity there is no one greater
          than John. And yet the least citizen of the Kingdom of God is greater
          than he."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>And all who heard John preach--even the
        most wicked of them--agreed that God's requirements were right, and they
        were baptized by him. <span className="sup">30</span>All, that is,
        except the Pharisees and teachers of Moses' Law. They rejected God's
        plan for them and refused John's baptism.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"What can I say about such men?"
        <span>Jesus asked</span> "With what shall I compare them?
        <span className="sup">32</span>They are like a group of children who
        complain to their friends, 'You don't like it if we play "wedding" and
        you don't like it if we play "funeral"'! <span className="sup">33</span>
        For John the Baptist used to go without food and never took a drop of
        liquor all his life, and you said, 'He must be crazy!'
        <span className="sup">34</span>But I eat my food and drink my wine, and
        you say, 'What a glutton Jesus is! And he drinks! And has the lowest
        sort of friends!' <span className="sup">35</span>But I am sure you can
        always justify your inconsistencies."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to come
        to his home for lunch and Jesus accepted the invitation. As they sat
        down to eat, <span className="sup">37</span>a woman of the streets--a
        prostitute--heard he was there and brought an exquisite flask filled
        with expensive perfume. <span className="sup">38</span>Going in, she
        knelt behind him at his feet, weeping, with her tears falling down upon
        his feet; and she wiped them off with her hair and kissed them and
        poured the perfume on them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>When Jesus' host, a Pharisee, saw what
        was happening and who the woman was, he said to himself, "This proves
        that Jesus is no prophet, for if God had really sent him, he would know
        what kind of woman this one is!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>Then Jesus spoke up and answered his
        thoughts.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Simon," <span>he said to the Pharisee,</span> "I have something to
          say to you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">"All right, Teacher," Simon replied, "go ahead."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then Jesus told him this story:
        <span class="jesus">
          "A man loaned money to two people--$5,000 to one and $500 to the
          other. <span className="sup">40</span>But neither of them could pay
          him back, so he kindly forgave them both, letting them keep the money!
          Which do you suppose loved him most after that?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>"I suppose the one who had owed him the
        most," Simon answered.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">"Correct," </span>Jesus agreed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>Then he turned to the woman and said to
        Simon,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Look! See this woman kneeling here! When I entered your home, you
          didn't bother to offer me water to wash the dust from my feet, but she
          has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
          <span className="sup">45</span>You refused me the customary kiss of
          greeting, but she has kissed my feet again and again from the time I
          first came in. <span className="sup">46</span>You neglected the usual
          courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has covered my feet
          with rare perfume. <span className="sup">47</span>Therefore her
          sins--and they are many--are forgiven, for she loved me much; but one
          who is forgiven little, show little love."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>And he said to her,
        <span class="jesus">"Your sins are forgiven."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>Then the men at the table said to
        themselves, "Who does this man think he is, going around forgiving
        sins?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>And Jesus said to the woman,
        <span class="jesus">"Your faith has saved you; go in peace."</span>
      </p>
    </>
