      <h3>Chapter 18</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day Jesus told his disciples a story to illustrate their need for
        constant prayer and to show them that they must keep praying until the
        answer comes.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"There was a city judge,"
        <span>he said,</span> "a very godless man who had great contempt for
        everyone. <span className="sup">3</span>A widow of that city came to him
        frequently to appeal for justice against a man who had harmed her.
        <span className="sup">4,5</span>The judge ignored her for a while, but
        eventually she got on his nerves.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "'I fear neither God nor man,' he said to himself, 'but this woman
        bothers me. I'm going to see that she gets justice, for she is wearing
        me out with her constant coming!'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Then the Lord said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If even an evil judge can be worn down like that,
          <span className="sup">7</span>don't you think that God will surely
          give justice to his people who plead with him day and night?
          <span className="sup">8</span>Yes! He will answer them quickly! But
          the question is: When I, the Messiah, return, how many will I find who
          have faith [and are praying]?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>Then he told this story to some who
        boasted of their virtue and scorned everyone:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"Two men went to the Temple to pray. One
        was a proud, self-righteous Pharisee, and the other a cheating tax
        collector. <span className="sup">11</span>The proud Pharisee 'prayed'
        this prayer: 'Thank God, I am not a sinner like everyone else,
        especially like that tax collector over there! For I never cheat, I
        don't commit adultery, <span className="sup">12</span>I go without food
        twice a week, and I give to God a tenth of everything I earn.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"But the corrupt tax collector stood at a
        distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed, but
        beat upon his chest in sorrow, exclaiming, 'God, be merciful to me, a
        sinner.' <span className="sup">14</span>I tell you, this sinner, not the
        Pharisee, returned home forgiven! For the proud shall be humbled, but
        the humble shall be honored."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>One day some mothers brought their babies
        to him to touch and bless. But the disciples told them to go away.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16,17</span>Then Jesus called the children over to
        him and said to the disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let the little children come to me! Never send them away! For the
          Kingdom of God belongs to men who have hearts as trusting as these
          little children's. And anyone who doesn't have their kind of faith
          will never get within the Kingdom's gates."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>Once a Jewish religious leader asked him
        this question: "Good sir, what shall I do to get to heaven?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"Do you realize what you are saying when
        you call me 'good'?" <span>Jesus asked him. </span>"Only God is truly
        good, and no one else.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But as to your question, you know what
        the ten commandments say--don't commit adultery, don't murder, don't
        steal, don't lie, honor your parents, and so on."
        <span>
          <span className="sup">21</span>The man replied, "I've obeyed every one
          of these laws since I was a small child."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>"There is still one thing you lack,"
        <span>Jesus said,</span> "Sell all you have and give the money to the
        poor--it will become treasure for you in heaven--and come, follow me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>But when the man heard this he went sadly
        away, for he was very rich.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>Jesus watched him go and then said to his
        disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!
          <span className="sup">25</span>It is easier for a camel to go through
          the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Those who heard him say this exclaimed,
        "If it is that hard, how can <em>anyone</em> be saved?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">"God can do what men can't!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>And Peter said, "We have left our homes
        and followed you."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"Yes," <span>Jesus replied, </span>"and
        everyone who has done as you have, leaving home, wife, brothers,
        parents, or children for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
        <span className="sup">30</span>will be repaid many times over now, as
        well as receiving eternal life in the world to come."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Gathering the Twelve around him he told
        them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "As you know, we are going to Jerusalem. And when we get there, all
          the predictions of the ancient prophets concerning me will come true.
          <span className="sup">32</span>I will be handed over to the Gentiles
          to be mocked and treated shamefully and spat upon,
          <span className="sup">33</span>and lashed and killed. And the third
          day I will rise again."

      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>But they didn't understand a thing he
        said. He seemed to be talking in riddles.

      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>As they approached Jericho, a blind man
        was sitting beside the road, begging from travelers.
        <span className="sup">36</span>When he heard the noise of a crowd going
        past, he asked what was happening. <span className="sup">37</span>He was
        told that Jesus from Nazareth was going by,
        <span className="sup">38</span>so he began shouting, "Jesus, Son of
        David, have mercy on me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>The crowds ahead of Jesus tried to hush
        the man, but he only yelled the louder, "Son of David, have mercy on
        me!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>When Jesus arrived at the spot, he

          "Bring the blind man over here,"

            he said. <span className="sup">41</span>Then Jesus asked the man,{' '}

      <p className="quote">"Lord," he pleaded, "I want to see!"</p>
