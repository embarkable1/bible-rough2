      <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        About this time Caesar Augustus, the Roman Emperor, decreed that a
        census should be taken throughout the nation.
        <span className="sup">2</span>(This census was taken when Quirinius was
        governor of Syria.)
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Everyone was required to return to his
        ancestral home for this registration. <span className="sup">4</span>And
        because Joseph was a member of the royal line, he had to go to Bethlehem
        in Judea, King David's ancient home--journeying there from the Galilean
        village of Nazareth. <span className="sup">5</span>He took with him
        Mary, his fiancée, who was obviously pregnant by this time.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>And while they were there, the time came
        for her baby to be born; <span className="sup">7</span>and she gave
        birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in a blanket and laid
        him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the village inn.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>That night some shepherds were in the
        fields outside the village, guarding their flocks of sheep.
        <span className="sup">9</span>Suddenly an angel appeared among them, and
        the landscape shone bright with the glory of the Lord. They were badly
        frightened, <span className="sup">10</span>but the angel reassured them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you the most joyful news every
        announced, and it is for everyone! <span className="sup">11</span>The
        Savior--yes, the Messiah, the Lord--has been born tonight in Bethlehem!
        <span className="sup">12</span>How will you recognize him? You will find
        a baby wrapped in a blanket, lying in a manger!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast
        host of others--the armies of heaven--praising God:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"Glory to God in the highest heaven,"
        they sang, "and peace on earth for all those pleasing him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>When this great army of angels had
        returned again to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Come on!
        Let's go to Bethlehem! Let's see this wonderful thing that has happened,
        which the Lord has told us about."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>They ran to the village and found their
        way to Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.
        <span className="sup">17</span>The shepherd told everyone what had
        happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.
        <span className="sup">18</span>All who heard the shepherds' story
        expressed astonishment, <span className="sup">19</span>but Mary quietly
        treasured these things in her heart and often thought about them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then the shepherds went back again to
        their fields and flocks, praising God for the visit of the angels, and
        because they had seen the child, just as the angel had told them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Eight days later, at the baby's
        circumcision ceremony, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the
        angel before he was even conceived.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>When the time came for Mary's
        purification offering at the Temple, as required by the laws of Moses
        after the birth of a child, his parents took him to Jerusalem to present
        him to the Lord; <span className="sup">23</span>for in these laws God
        had said, "If a woman's first child is a boy, he shall be dedicated to
        the Lord."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>At that time Jesus' parents also offered
        their sacrifice for purification--"either a pair of turtle-doves or two
        young pigeons" was the legal requirement.
        <span className="sup">25</span>That day a man named Simeon, a Jerusalem
        resident, was in the Temple. He was a good man, very devout, filled with
        the Holy Spirit and constantly expecting the Messiah to come soon.
        <span className="sup">26</span>For the Holy Spirit had revealed to him
        that he would not die until he had seen him--God's anointed King.
        <span className="sup">27</span>The Holy Spirit had impelled him to go to
        the Temple that day; and so, when Mary and Joseph arrived to present the
        baby Jesus to the Lord in obedience to the law,
        <span className="sup">28</span>Simeon was there and took the child in
        his arms, praising God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29,30,31</span>"Lord," he said, "now I can die
        content! For I have seen him as you promised me I would. I have seen the
        Savior you have given to the world. <span className="sup">32</span>He is
        the Light that will shine upon the nations, and he will be the glory of
        your people Israel!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Joseph and Mary just stood there,
        marveling at what was being said about Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34,35</span>Simeon blessed them but then said to
        Mary, "A sword shall pierce your soul, for this child shall be rejected
        by many in Israel, and this to their undoing. But he will be the
        greatest joy of many others. And the deepest thoughts of many hearts
        shall be revealed."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36,37</span>Anna, a prophetess, was also there in
        the Temple that day. She was the daughter of Phanuel, of the Jewish
        tribe of Asher, and was very old, for she had been a widow for
        eighty-four years following seven years of marriage. She never left the
        Temple but stayed there night and day, worshipping God by praying and
        often fasting.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>She came along just as Simeon was talking
        with Mary and Joseph, and she also began thanking God and telling
        everyone in Jerusalem who had been awaiting the coming of the Savior
        that the Messiah had finally arrived.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>When Jesus' parents had fulfilled all the
        requirements of the Law of God they returned home to Nazareth in
        Galilee. <span className="sup">40</span>There the child became a strong,
        robust lad, and was known for wisdom beyond his years; and God poured
        out his blessings on him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41,42</span>When Jesus was twelve years old he
        accompanied his parents to Jerusalem for the annual Passover Festival,
        which they attended each year. <span className="sup">43</span>After the
        celebration was over they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed
        behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn't miss him the first day,
        <span className="sup">44</span>for they assumed he was with friends
        among the other travelers. But when he didn't show up that evening, they
        started to look for him among their relatives and friends;
        <span className="sup">45</span>and when they couldn't find him, they
        went back to Jerusalem to search for him there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46,47</span>Three days later they finally
        discovered him. He was in the Temple, sitting among the teachers of Law,
        discussing deep questions with them and amazing everyone with his
        understanding and answers.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>His parents didn't know what to think.
        "Son!" his mother said to him. "Why have you done this to us? Your
        father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "But why did you need to search?" <span>he asked. </span>"Didn't you
          realize that I would be here at the Temple, in my Father's House?"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">50</span>But they didn't understand what he meant.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>Then he returned to Nazareth with them
        and was obedient to them; and his mother stored away all these things in
        her heart. <span className="sup">52</span>So Jesus grew both tall and
        wise, and was loved by God and man.
