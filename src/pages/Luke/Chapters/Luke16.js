      <h3>Chapter 16</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Jesus now told this story to his disciples:
        <span class="jesus">
          "A rich man hired an accountant to handle his affairs, but soon a
          rumor went around that the accountant was thoroughly dishonest.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">2</span>"So his employer called him in and said,
        'What's this I hear about your stealing from me? Get your report in
        order, for you are to be dismissed.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"The accountant thought to himself, 'Now
        what? I'm through here, and I haven't the strength to go out and dig
        ditches, and I'm too proud to beg. <span className="sup">4</span>I know
        just the thing! And then I'll have plenty of friends to take care of me
        when I leave!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5,6</span>"So he invited each one who owed money
        to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first
        one, 'How much do you owe him?' 'My debt is 850 gallons of olive oil,'
        the man replied. 'Yes, here is the contract you signed,' the accountant
        told him. 'Tear it up and write another one for half that much!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"'And how much do you owe him?' he asked
        the next man. 'A thousand bushels of wheat,' was the reply. 'Here,' the
        accountant said, 'take your note and replace it with one for only 800
        bushels!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"The rich man had to admire the rascal for
        being so shrewd. And it is true that the citizens of this world are more
        clever [in dishonesty!] than the godly are.
        <span className="sup">9</span>But shall I tell <em>you</em> to act that
        way, to buy friendship through cheating? Will this ensure your entry
        into an everlasting home in heaven? <span className="sup">10</span>{' '}
        <em>No!</em> For unless you are honest in small matters, you won't be in
        large ones. If you cheat even a little, you won't be honest with greater
        responsibilities. <span className="sup">11</span>And if you are
        untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true
        riches of heaven? <span className="sup">12</span>And if you are not
        faithful with other people's money, why should you be entrusted with
        money of your own?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"For neither you nor anyone else can
        serve two masters. You will hate one and show loyalty to the other, or
        else the other way around--you will be enthusiastic about one and
        despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>The Pharisees, who dearly loved their
        money, naturally scoffed at all this.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Then he said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You wear a noble, pious expression in public, but God knows your evil
          hearts. Your pretense brings you honor from the people, but it is an
          abomination in the sight of God. <span className="sup">16</span>Until
          John the Baptist began to preach, the laws of Moses and the messages
          of the prophets were your guides. But John introduced the Good News
          that the Kingdom of God would come soon. And now eager multitudes are
          pressing in. <span className="sup">17</span>But that doesn't mean that
          the Law has lost its force in even the smallest point. It is as strong
          and unshakable as heaven and earth.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"So anyone who divorces his wife and
        marries someone else commits adultery, and anyone who marries a divorced
        woman commits adultery."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"There was a certain rich man,"
        <span>Jesus said, </span>"who was splendidly clothed and lived each day
        in mirth and luxury. <span className="sup">20</span>One day Lazarus, a
        diseased beggar, was laid at his door. <span className="sup">21</span>As
        he lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs
        would come and lick his open sores. <span className="sup">22</span>
        Finally the beggar died and was carried by the angels to be with Abraham
        in the place of the righteous dead. The rich man also died and was
        buried,
        <span className="sup">23</span>and his soul went into hell. There, in
        torment, he saw Lazarus in the far distance with Abraham.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"'Father Abraham,' he shouted, 'have some
        pity! Send Lazarus over here if only to dip the tip of his finger in
        water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in these flames.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"But Abraham said to him, 'Son, remember
        that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had
        nothing. So now he is here being comforted and you are in anguish.
        <span className="sup">26</span>And besides, there is a great chasm
        separating us, and anyone wanting to come to you from here is stopped at
        its edge; and no one over there can cross to us.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Then the rich man said, 'O Father
        Abraham, then please send him to my father's home--
        <span className="sup">28</span>for I have five brothers--to warn them
        about this place of torment lest they come here when they die.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>"But Abraham said, 'The Scriptures have
        warned them again and again. Your brothers can read them any time they
        want to.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"The rich man replied, 'No, Father
        Abraham, they won't bother to read them. But if someone is sent to them
        from the dead, then they will turn from their sins.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"But Abraham said, 'If they won't listen
        to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even though someone rises
        from the dead.'"
