      <h3>Chapter 12</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Meanwhile the crowds grew until thousands upon thousands were milling
        about and crushing each other. He turned now to his disciples and warned
        them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "More than anything else, beware of these Pharisees and the way they
          pretend to be good when they aren't. But such hypocrisy cannot be
          hidden forever. <span className="sup">2</span>It will become as
          evident as yeast in dough. <span className="sup">3</span>Whatever they
          have said in the dark shall be heard in the light, and what you have
          whispered in the inner rooms shall be broadcast from the housetops for
          all to hear!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>"Dear friends, don't be afraid of these
        who want to murder you. They can only kill the body; they have no power
        over your souls. <span className="sup">5</span>But I'll tell you whom to
        fear--fear God who has the power to kill and then cast into hell.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"What is the price of five sparrows? A
        couple of pennies? Not much more than that. Yet God does not forget a
        single one of them. <span className="sup">7</span>And he knows the
        number of hairs on your head! Never fear, you are far more valuable to
        him than a whole flock of sparrows.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>"And I assure you of this: I, the Messiah,
        will publicly honor you in the presence of God's angels if you publicly
        acknowledge me here on earth as your Friend.
        <span className="sup">9</span>But I will deny before the angels who deny
        me here among men. <span className="sup">10</span>(Yet those who speak
        against me may be forgiven--while those who speak against the Holy
        Spirit shall never be forgiven.)
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"And when you are brought to trial before
        these Jewish rulers and authorities in the synagogues, don't be
        concerned about what to say in your defense,
        <span className="sup">12</span>for the Holy Spirit will give you the
        right words even as you are standing there."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then someone called from the crowd, "Sir,
        please tell my brother to divide my father's estate with me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Man, who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that?
          <span className="sup">15</span>Beware! Don't always be wishing for
          what you don't have. For real life and real living are not related to
          how rich we are."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">16</span>Then he gave an illustration:
        </span>{' '}
        "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.
        <span className="sup">17</span>In fact, his barns were full to
        overflowing--he couldn't get everything in. He thought about his
        problem, <span className="sup">18</span>and finally exclaimed, 'I
        know--I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones! Then I'll have room
        enough.
        <span className="sup">19</span>And I'll sit back and say to myself,
        "Friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it
        easy! Wine, women, and song for you!"'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But God said to him, 'Fool! Tonight you
        die. Then who will get it all?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Yes, every man is a fool who gets rich
        on earth but not in heaven."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">22</span>Then turning to his disciples he said,
        </span>
        "Don't worry about whether you have enough food to eat or clothes to
        wear. <span className="sup">23</span>For life consists of far more than
        food and clothes. <span className="sup">24</span>Look at the
        ravens--they don't plant or harvest or have barns to store away their
        food, and yet they get along all right--for God feeds them. And you are
        far more valuable to him than any birds!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"And besides, what's the use of worrying?
        What good does it do? Will it add a single day to your life? Of course
        not! <span className="sup">26</span>And if worry can't even do such
        little things as that, what's the use of worrying over bigger things?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"Look at the lilies! They don't toil and
        spin, and yet Solomon in all his glory was not robed as well as they
        are. <span className="sup">28</span>And if God provides clothing for the
        flowers that are here today and gone tomorrow, don't you suppose that he
        will provide clothing for you, you doubters?
        <span className="sup">29</span>And don't worry about food--what to eat
        and drink; don't worry at all that God will provide it for you.
        <span className="sup">30</span>All mankind scratches for its daily
        bread, but your heavenly Father knows your needs.{' '}
        <span className="sup">31</span>He will always give you all you need from
        day to day if you will make the Kingdom of God your primary concern.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"So don't be afraid, little flock. For it
        gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.
        <span className="sup">33</span>Sell what you have and give to those in
        need. This will fatten your purses in heaven! And the purses of heaven
        have no rips or holes in them. Your treasures there will never
        disappear; no thief can steal them; no moth can destroy them.
        <span className="sup">34</span>Wherever your treasure is, there your
        heart and thoughts will also be.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>"Be prepared--all dressed and ready--
        <span className="sup">36</span>for your Lord's return from the wedding
        feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment
        he arrives and knocks. <span className="sup">37</span>There will be
        great joy for those who are ready and waiting for his return. He himself
        will seat them and put on a waiter's uniform and serve them as they sit
        and eat! <span className="sup">38</span>He may come at nine o'clock at
        night--or even at midnight. But whenever he comes there will be joy for
        his servants who are ready!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Everyone would be ready for him if they
        knew the exact hour of his return--just as they would be ready for a
        thief if they knew when he was coming. <span className="sup">40</span>So
        be ready all the time. For I, the Messiah, will come when least
        expected."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Peter asked, "Lord, are you talking just
        to us or to everyone?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">42,43,44</span>And the Lord replied,{' '}
        </span>
        "I'm talking to any faithful, sensible man whose master gives him the
        responsibility of feeding the other servants. If his master returns and
        finds that he has done a good job, there will be a reward--his master
        will put him in charge of all he owns.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>"But if the man begins to think, 'My Lord
        won't be back for a long time,' and begins to whip the men and women he
        is supposed to protect, and to spend his time at drinking parties and in
        drunkenness-- <span className="sup">46</span>well, his master will
        return without notice and remove him from his position of trust and
        assign him to the place of the unfaithful.{' '}
        <span className="sup">47</span>He will be severely punished, for though
        he knew his duty he refused to do it.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>"But anyone who is not aware that he is
        doing wrong will be punished only lightly. Much is required from those
        to whom much is given, for their responsibility is greater.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>"I have come to bring fire to the earth,
        and, oh, that my task were completed! <span className="sup">50</span>
        There is a terrible baptism ahead of me, and how I am pent up until it
        is accomplished!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>"Do you think I have come to give peace
        to the earth? <em>No!</em> Rather, strife and division!
        <span className="sup">50</span>From now on families will be split apart,
        three in favor of me, and two against--or perhaps the other way around.
        <span className="sup">51</span>A father will decide one way about me;
        his son, the other; mother and daughter will disagree; and the decision
        of an honored mother-in-law will be spurned by her daughter-in-law.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>Then he turned to the crowd and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When you see clouds beginning to form in the west, you say, 'Here
          comes a shower.' And you are right.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>"When the south wind blows you say,
        'Today will be a scorcher.' And it is. <span className="sup">56</span>
        Hypocrites! You interpret the sky well enough, but you refuse to notice
        the warnings all around you about the crisis ahead.{' '}
        <span className="sup">57</span>Why do you refuse to see for yourselves
        what is right?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">58</span>"If you meet your accuser on the way to
        court, try to settle the matter before it reaches the judge, lest he
        sentence you to jail; <span className="sup">59</span>for if that happens
        you won't be free again until the last penny is pain in full."
