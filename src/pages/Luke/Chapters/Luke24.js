      <h3>Chapter 24</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        But very early on Sunday morning they took the ointments to the tomb--
        <span className="sup">2</span>and found that the huge stone covering the
        entrance had been rolled aside. <span className="sup">3</span>So they
        went in--but the Lord Jesus' body was gone.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>They stood there puzzled, trying to think
        what could have happened to it. Suddenly two men appeared before them,
        clothed in shining robes so bright their eyes were dazzled.
        <span className="sup">5</span>The women were terrified and bowed low
        before them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then the men asked, "Why are you looking in a tomb for someone who is
        alive? <span className="sup">6,7</span>He isn't here! He has come back
        to life again! Don't you remember what he told you back in Galilee--that
        the Messiah must be betrayed into the power of evil men and be crucified
        and that he would rise again the third day?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Then they remembered,
        <span className="sup">9</span>and rushed back to Jerusalem to tell his
        eleven disciples--and everyone else--what had happened.
        <span className="sup">10</span>(The women who went to the tomb were Mary
        Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James, and several others.)
        <span className="sup">11</span>But the story sounded like a fairy tale
        to the men--they didn't believe it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>However, Peter ran to the tomb to look.
        Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; and then he
        went back home again, wondering what had happened.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>That same day, Sunday, two of Jesus'
        followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles out of
        Jerusalem. <span className="sup">14</span>As they walked along they were
        talking of Jesus' death, <span className="sup">15</span>when suddenly
        Jesus himself came along and joined them and began walking beside them.
        <span className="sup">16</span>But they didn't recognize him, for God
        kept them from it.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "You seem to be in a deep discussion about something,"
          <span>he said. </span>"What are you so concerned about?"
        </span>
        They stopped short, sadness written across their faces.
        <span className="sup">18</span>And one of them, Cleopas, replied, "You
        must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about the terrible
        things that happened there last week."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>
        <span class="jesus">"What things?"</span> Jesus asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "The things that happened to Jesus, the Man from Nazareth," they said.
        "He was a Prophet who did incredible miracles and was a mighty Teacher,
        highly regarded by both God and man. <span className="sup">20</span>But
        the chief priests and our religious leaders arrested him and handed him
        over to the Roman government to be condemned to death, and they
        crucified him. <span className="sup">21</span>We had thought he was the
        glorious Messiah and that he had come to rescue Israel.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "And now, besides all this--which happened three days ago--
        <span className="sup">22,23</span>some women from our group of his
        followers were at his tomb early this morning and came back with an
        amazing report that his body was missing, and that they had seen some
        angels there who told them Jesus is alive!{' '}
        <span className="sup">24</span>Some of our men ran out to see, and sure
        enough, Jesus' body was gone, just as the women had said."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Then Jesus said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You are such foolish, foolish people! You find it so hard to believe
          all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures!
          <span className="sup">26</span>Wasn't it clearly predicted by the
          prophets that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before
          entering his time of glory?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Then Jesus quoted them passage after
        passage from the writings of the prophets, beginning with the book of
        Genesis and going right on through the Scriptures, explaining what the
        passages meant and what they said about himself.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>By this time they were nearing Emmaus and
        the end of their journey. Jesus would have gone on,
        <span className="sup">29</span>but they begged him to stay the night
        with them, as it was getting late. So he went home with them.
        <span className="sup">30</span>As they sat down to eat, he asked God's
        blessing on the food and then took a small loaf of bread and broke it
        and was passing it over to them, <span className="sup">31</span>when
        suddenly--it was as though their eyes were opened--they recognized him!
        And at that moment he disappeared!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>They began telling each other how their
        hearts had felt strangely warm as he talked with them and explained the
        Scriptures during the walk down the road.
        <span className="sup">33,34</span>Within the hour they were on their way
        back to Jerusalem, where the eleven disciples and the other followers of
        Jesus greeted them with these words, "The Lord has really risen! He
        appeared to Peter!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Then the two from Emmaus told their story
        of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road
        and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread.
        <span className="sup">36</span>And just as they were telling about it,
        Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them, and greeted them.
        <span className="sup">37</span>But the whole group was terribly
        frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why are you frightened?" <span>he asked. </span>"Why do you doubt
          that it is really I? <span className="sup">39</span>Look at my hands!
          Look at my feet! You can see that it is I, myself! Touch me and make
          sure that I am not a ghost! For ghosts don't have bodies, as you see
          that I do!"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">40</span>As he spoke, he held out his hands for
        them to see [the marks of the nails], and showed them [the wounds in]
        his feet.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Still they stood there undecided, filled
        with joy and doubt.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Do you have anything here to eat?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
        <span className="sup">43</span>and he ate it as they watched!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>Then he said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "When I was with you before, don't you remember my telling you that
          everything written about me by Moses and the prophets and in the
          Psalms must all come true?"
        </span>
        <span className="sup">45</span>Then he opened their minds to understand
        at last these many Scriptures! <span className="sup">46</span>And he
        said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah must suffer and die and
          rise again from the dead on the third day;
          <span className="sup">47</span>and that this message of salvation
          should be taken from Jerusalem to all the nations:
          <em>There is forgiveness of sins for all who turn to me.</em>
          <span className="sup">48</span>You have seen these prophecies come
          true.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">49</span>"And now I will send the Holy Spirit upon
        you, just as my Father promised. Don't begin telling others yet--stay
        here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power
        from heaven."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>Then Jesus led them out along the road to
        Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them,
        <span className="sup">51</span>and then began rising into the sky, and
        went on to heaven. <span className="sup">52</span>And they worshiped
        him, and returned to Jerusalem filled with mighty joy,
        <span className="sup">53</span>and were continually in the Temple,
        praising God.
