      <h3>Chapter 20</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        On one of those days when he was teaching and preaching the Good News in
        the Temple, he was confronted by the chief priests and other religious
        leaders and councilmen. <span className="sup">2</span>They demanded to
        know by what authority he had driven out the merchants from the Temple.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>"I'll ask you a question before I answer,"
        <span>
          he replied. <span className="sup">4</span>{' '}
        </span>
        "Was John sent by God, or was he merely acting under his own authority?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>They talked it over among themselves. "If
        we say his message was from heaven, then we are trapped because he will
        ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?' <span className="sup">6</span>
        But if we say John was not sent from God, the people will mob us, for
        they are convinced he was a prophet." <span className="sup">7</span>
        Finally they replied, "We don't know!"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">8</span>And Jesus responded,{' '}
        </span>
        "Then I won't answer your question either."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">9</span>Now he turned to the people again and
          told them this story:
        </span>
        "A man planted a vineyard and rented it out to some farmers, and went
        away to a distant land to live for several years.
        <span className="sup">10</span>When harvest time came, he sent one of
        his men to the farm to collect his share of the crops. But the tenants
        beat him up and sent him back empty-handed.{' '}
        <span className="sup">11</span>Then he sent another, but the same thing
        happened; he was beaten up and insulted and sent away without
        collecting. <span className="sup">12</span>A third man was sent and the
        same thing happened. He, too, was wounded and chased away.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"'What shall I do?' the owner asked
        himself. 'I know! I'll send my cherished son. Surely they will show
        respect for him.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"But when the tenants saw his son, they
        said. 'This is our chance! This fellow will inherit all the land when
        his father dies. Come on. Let's kill him, and then it will be ours.'
        <span className="sup">15</span>So they dragged him out of the vineyard
        and killed him.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "What do you think the owner will do? <span className="sup">16</span>
        I'll tell you--he will come and kill them and rent the vineyard to
        others."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "But they would never do a thing like that," his listeners protested.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus looked at them and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Then what does the Scripture mean where it says, 'The Stone rejected
          by the builders was made the cornerstone'?"
          <span className="sup">18</span>And he added, "Whoever stumbles over
          that Stone shall be broken; and those on whom it falls will be crushed
          to dust."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>When the chief priests and religious
        leaders heard about this story he had told, they wanted him arrested
        immediately, for they realized that he was talking about them. They were
        the wicked tenants in his illustration. But they were afraid that if
        they themselves arrested him there would be a riot. So they tried to get
        him to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor as
        reason for arrest by him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Watching their opportunity, they sent
        secret agents pretending to be honest men.{' '}
        <span className="sup">21</span>They said to Jesus, "Sir, we know what an
        honest teacher you are. You always tell the truth and don't budge an
        inch in the face of what others think, but teach the ways of God.{' '}
        <span className="sup">22</span>Now tell us--is it right to pay taxes to
        the Roman government or not?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>He saw through their trickery and said,
        <span className="sup">24</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Show me a coin. Whose portrait is this on it? And whose name?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">They replied, "Caesar's--the Roman emperor's."</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>He said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Then give the emperor all that is his--and give to God all that is
          his!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Thus their attempt to outwit him before
        the people failed; and marveling at his answer, they were silent.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Then some Sadducees--men who believed
        that death is the end of existence, that there is no resurrection--
        <span className="sup">28</span>came to Jesus with this:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "The laws of Moses state that if a man dies without children, the man's
        brother shall marry the widow and their children will legally belong to
        the dead man, to carry on his name. <span className="sup">29</span>We
        know of a family of seven brothers. The oldest married and then died
        without any children. <span className="sup">30</span>His brother married
        the widow and he, too, died. Still no children.{' '}
        <span className="sup">31</span>And so it went, one after the other,
        until each of the seven had married her and died, leaving no children.{' '}
        <span className="sup">32</span>Finally the woman died also.{' '}
        <span className="sup">33</span>Now here is our question: Whose wife will
        she be in the resurrection? For all of them were married to her!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34,35</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Marriage is for people here on earth, but when those who are counted
          worthy of being raised from the dead get to heaven, they do not marry.
          <span className="sup">36</span>And they never die again; in these
          respects they are like angels, and are sons of God, for they are
          raised up in new life from the dead.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">37,38</span>"But as to your real question--whether
        or not there is a resurrection--why, even the writings of Moses himself
        prove this. For when he describes how God appeared to him in the burning
        bush, he speaks of God as 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the
        God of Jacob.' To say that the Lord <em>is</em> some person's God means
        that person is <em>alive,</em> not dead! So from God's point of view,
        all men are living."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>"Well said, sir!" remarked some of the
        experts in the Jewish law who were standing there.
        <span className="sup">40</span>And that ended their questions, for they
        dared ask no more!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>Then he presented <em>them</em> with a
        question,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why is it," <span>he asked,</span> "that Christ, the Messiah, is said
          to be a descendant of King David?
          <span className="sup">42,43,</span>For David himself wrote in the book
          of Psalms: 'God said to my Lord, the Messiah, "Sit at my right hand
          until I place your enemies beneath your feet."'
          <span className="sup">44</span>How can the Messiah be both David's son
          and David's God at the same time?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Then, with the crowds listening, he
        turned to his disciples and said, <span className="sup">46</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Beware of these experts in religion, for they love to parade in
          dignified robes and to be bowed to by the people as they walk along
          the street. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and
          at religious festivals! <span className="sup">47</span>But even while
          they are praying long prayers with great outward piety, they are
          planning schemes to cheat widows out of their property. Therefore
          God's heaviest sentence awaits these men."
        </span>
      </p>
