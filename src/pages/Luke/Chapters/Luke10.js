      <h3>Chapter 10</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        The Lord now chose seventy other disciples and sent them on ahead in
        pairs to all the towns and villages he planned to visit later.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">2</span>These were his instructions to them:
        </span>
        "Plead with the Lord of the harvest to send out more laborers to help
        you, for the harvest is so plentiful and the workers so few.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Go now, and remember that I am sending you
        out as lambs among wolves. <span className="sup">4</span>Don't take any
        money with you, or a beggar's bag, or even an extra pair of shoes. And
        don't waste time along the way.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Whenever you enter a home, give it your
        blessing. <span className="sup">6</span>If it is worthy of the blessing,
        the blessing will stand; if not, the blessing will return to you.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>"When you enter a village, don't shift
        around from home to home, but stay in one place, eating and drinking
        without question whatever is set before you. And don't hesitate to
        accept hospitality, for the workman is worthy of his wages!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">8.9</span>"If a town welcomes you, follow these
        two rules:
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">(1) Eat whatever is set before you.</p>
      <p class="jesus quote__long">
        (2) Heal the sick; and as you heal them, say, 'The Kingdom of God is
        very near you now.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"But if a town refuses you, go out into
        its streets and say, <span className="sup">11</span>'We wipe the dust of
        your town from our feet as a public announcement of your doom. Never
        forget how close you were to the Kingdom of God!'
        <span className="sup">12</span>Even wicked Sodom will be better off than
        such a city on the Judgment Day. <span className="sup">13</span>What
        horrors await you, you cities of Chorazin and Bethsaida! For if the
        miracles I did for you had been done in the cities of Tyre and Sidon,
        their people would have sat in deep repentance long ago, clothed in
        sack-cloth and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.
        <span className="sup">14</span>Yes, Tyre and Sidon will receive less
        punishment on the Judgment Day than you. <span className="sup">15</span>
        And you people of Capernaum, what shall I say about you? Will you be
        exalted to heaven? No, you shall be brought down to hell."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Then he said to the disciples,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Those who welcome you are welcoming me. And those who reject you are
          rejecting me. And those who reject me are rejecting God who sent me."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>When the seventy disciples returned, they
        joyfully reported to him, "Even the demons obey us when we use your
        name."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"Yes," <span>he told them, </span>"I saw
        Satan falling from heaven as a flash of lightning!
        <span className="sup">19</span>And I have given you authority over all
        the power of the Enemy, and to walk among serpents and scorpions and to
        crush them. Nothing shall injure you!
        <span className="sup">20</span>However, the important thing is not that
        demons obey you, but that your names are registered as citizens of
        heaven."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then he was filled with the joy of the
        Holy Spirit and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I praise you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these
          things from the intellectuals and worldly wise and for revealing them
          to those who are as trusting as little children. Yes, thank you,
          Father, for that is the way you wanted it.
          <span className="sup">22</span>I am the Agent of my Father in
          everything; and no one really knows the Son except the Father, and no
          one really knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son
          chooses to reveal him."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then, turning to the twelve disciples, he
        said quietly,
        <span class="jesus">
          "How privileged you are to see what you have seen.
          <span className="sup">24</span>Many a prophet and king of old has
          longed for these days, to see and hear what you have seen and heard!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>One day an expert on Moses' laws came to
        test Jesus' orthodoxy by asking him this question: "Teacher, what does a
        man need to do to live forever in heaven?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">"What does Moses' law say about it?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>"It says," he replied, "that you must
        love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and
        with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your
        neighbor just as much as you love yourself."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Right!" <span>Jesus told him. </span>" <em>Do</em> this and
          <em>you</em> shall live!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>The man wanted to justify (his lack of
        love for some kinds of people), so he asked, "Which neighbors?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>Jesus replied with an illustration:
        <span class="jesus">
          "A Jew going on a trip from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by
          bandits. They stripped him of his clothes and money and beat him up
          and left him lying half dead beside the road.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"By chance a Jewish priest came along;
        and when he saw the man lying there, he crossed to the other side of the
        road and passed him by. <span className="sup">32</span>A Jewish
        Temple-assistant walked over and looked at him lying there, but then
        went on.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>"But a despised Samaritan came along, and
        when he saw him, he felt deep pity. <span className="sup">34</span>
        Kneeling beside him the Samaritan soothed his wounds with medicine and
        bandaged them. Then he put the man on his donkey and walked along beside
        him till they came to an inn, where he nursed him through the night.
        <span className="sup">35</span>The next day he handed the innkeeper a
        day's wage and told him to take care of the man. 'If his bill runs
        higher than that,' he said, 'I'll pay the difference the next time I am
        here.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>"Now which of these three would you say
        was a neighbor to the bandits' victim?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>The man replied, "The one who showed him
        some pity."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">"Yes, now go and do the same."</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>As Jesus and the disciples continued on
        their way to Jerusalem they came to a village where a woman named Martha
        welcomed them into her home. <span className="sup">39</span>Her sister
        Mary sat on the floor, listening to Jesus as he talked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>But Martha was the jittery type, and was
        worrying over the big dinner she was preparing.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        She came to Jesus and said, "Sir, doesn't it seem unfair to you that my
        sister just sits here while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help
        me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>But the Lord said to her,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Martha, dear friend, you are so upset over all these details!
          <span className="sup">42</span>There is really only one thing worth
          being concerned about. Mary has discovered it--and I won't take it
          away from her!"
        </span>
