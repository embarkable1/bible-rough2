      <h3>Chapter 14</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One Sabbath as he was in the home of a member of the Jewish Council, the
        Pharisees were watching him like hawks to see if he would heal a man who
        was present who was suffering from dropsy.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Jesus said to the Pharisees and legal
        experts standing around,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Well, is it within the Law to heal a man on the Sabbath day, or not?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>And when they refused to answer, Jesus
        took the sick man by the hand and healed him and sent him away.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then he turned to them:
        <span class="jesus">
          "Which of you doesn't work on the Sabbath?"
          <span>he asked. </span>"If your cow falls into a pit, don't you
          proceed at once to get it out?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Again they had no answer.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>When he noticed that all who came to the
        dinner were trying to sit near the head of the table, he gave them this
        advice: <span className="sup">8</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "If you are invited to a wedding feast, don't always head for the best
          seat. For if someone more respected than you shows up,
          <span className="sup">9</span>the host will bring him over to where
          you are sitting and say, 'Let this man sit here instead.' And you,
          embarrassed, will have to take whatever seat is left at the foot of
          the table!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>"Do this instead--start at the foot; and
        when your host sees you he will come and say, 'Friend, we have a better
        place than this for you!' Thus you will be honored in front of all the
        other guests. <span className="sup">11</span>For everyone who tries to
        honor himself shall be humbled; and he who humbles himself shall be
        honored."
        <span>
          <span className="sup">12</span>Then he turned to his host.{' '}
        </span>
        "When you put on a dinner," <span>he said,</span> "don't invite friends,
        brothers, relatives, and rich neighbors! For they will return the
        invitation. <span className="sup">13</span>Instead, invite the poor, the
        crippled, the lame, and the blind. <span className="sup">14</span>Then
        at the resurrection of the godly, God will reward you for inviting those
        who can't repay you."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Hearing this, a man sitting at the table
        with Jesus exclaimed, "What a privilege it would be to get into the
        Kingdom of God!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Jesus replied with this illustration:
        <span class="jesus">
          "A man prepared a great feast and sent out many invitations.
          <span className="sup">17</span>When all was ready, he sent his servant
          around to notify the guests that it was time for them to arrive.
          <span className="sup">18</span>But they all began making excuses. One
          said he had just bought a field and wanted to inspect it, and asked to
          be excused. <span className="sup">19</span>Another said he had just
          bought five pair of oxen and wanted to try them out.
          <span className="sup">20</span>Another had just been married and for
          that reason couldn't come.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"The servant returned and reported to his
        master what they had said. His master was angry and told him to go
        quickly into the streets and alleys of the city and to invite the
        beggars, crippled, lame, and blind. <span className="sup">22</span>But
        even then, there was still room.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>"'Well, then,' said his master, 'go out
        into the country lanes and out behind the hedges and urge anyone you
        find to come, so that the house will be full.{' '}
        <span className="sup">24</span>For none of those I invited first will
        get even the smallest taste of what I had prepared for them.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>Great crowds were following him. He
        turned around and addressed them as follows:{' '}
        <span className="sup">26</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Anyone who wants to be my follower must love me far more than he does
          his own father, mother, wife, children, brothers, or sisters--yes,
          more than his own life-- otherwise he cannot be my disciple.{' '}
          <span className="sup">27</span>And no one can be my disciple who does
          not carry his own cross and follow me.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"But don't begin until you count the
        cost. For who would begin construction of a building without first
        getting estimates and then checking to see if he has enough money to pay
        the bills? <span className="sup">29</span>Otherwise he might complete
        only the foundation before running out of funds. And then how everyone
        would laugh!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>"'See that fellow there?' they would
        mock. 'He started that building and ran out of money before it was
        finished!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Or what king would ever dream of going
        to war without first sitting down with his counselors and discussing
        whether his army of 10,000 is strong enough to defeat the 20,000 men who
        are marching against him?
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>"If the decision is negative, then while
        the enemy troops are still far away, he will send a truce team to
        discuss terms of peace. <span className="sup">33</span>So no one can
        become my disciple unless he first sits down and counts his
        blessings--and then renounces them all for me.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>"What good is salt that has lost its
        saltiness? <span className="sup">35</span>Flavorless salt is fit for
        nothing--not even for fertilizer. It is worthless and must be thrown
        out. Listen well, if you would understand my meaning."
