      <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, left the Jordan River, being urged
        by the Spirit out into the barren wastelands of Judea, where Satan
        tempted him for forty days. He ate nothing all that time, and was very
        hungry.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>Satan said, "If you are God's Son, tell
        this stone to become a loaf of bread."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is written in the Scriptures, 'Other things in life are much more
          important than bread!'"
        </span>
        <small>Deuteronomy 8:3</small>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then Satan took him up and revealed to him
        all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time;
        <span className="sup">6,7</span>and the devil told him, "I will give you
        all these splendid kingdoms and their glory--for they are mine to give
        to anyone I wish--if you will only get down on your knees and worship
        me."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "We must worship God, and him alone. So it is written in the
          Scriptures."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9,10,11</span>Then Satan took him to Jerusalem to
        a high roof of the Temple and said, "If you are the Son of God, jump
        off! For the Scriptures say that God will send his angels to guard you
        and to keep from crashing to the pavement below!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Scriptures also say, 'Do not put the Lord your God to a foolish
          test.'"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>When the devil had ended all the
        temptations, he left Jesus for a while and went away.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>Then Jesus returned to Galilee, full of
        the Holy Spirit's power. Soon he became well known throughout all that
        region <span className="sup">15</span>for his sermons in the synagogues;
        everyone praised him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>When he came to the village of Nazareth,
        his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on Saturday, and
        stood up to read the Scriptures. <span className="sup">17</span>The book
        of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him, and he opened it to the place
        where it says:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18,19</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; he has appointed me to preach Good
          News to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to
          announce that captives shall be released and the blind shall see, that
          the downtrodden shall be freed from their oppressors, and that God is
          ready to give blessings to all who come to him."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>He closed the book and handed it back to
        the attendant and sat down, while everyone in the synagogue gazed at him
        intently. <span className="sup">21</span>Then he added,
        <span class="jesus">"These Scriptures came true today!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>All who were there spoke well of him and
        were amazed by the beautiful words that fell from his lips. "How can
        this be?" they asked. "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span>
          <span className="sup">23</span>Then he said,{' '}
        </span>
        "Probably you will quote me that proverb, 'Physician, heal
        yourself'--meaning, 'Why don't you do miracles here in your home town
        like those you did in Capernaum?'
        <span className="sup">24</span>But I solemnly declare to you that no
        prophet is accepted in his own home town!{' '}
        <span className="sup">25,26</span>For example, remember how Elijah the
        prophet used a miracle to help the widow of Zarephath--a foreigner from
        the land of Sidon. There were many Jewish widows needing help in those
        days of famine, for there had been no rain for three and one-half years,
        and hunger stalked the land; yet Elijah was not sent to them.{' '}
        <span className="sup">27</span>Or think of the prophet Elisha, who
        healed Naaman, a Syrian, rather than the many Jewish lepers needing
        help."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>These remarks stung them to fury;
        <span className="sup">29</span>and jumping up, they mobbed him and took
        him to the edge of the hill on which the city was built, to push him
        over the cliff. <span className="sup">30</span>But he walked away
        through the crowd and left them.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Then he returned to Capernaum, a city in
        Galilee, and preached there in the synagogue every Saturday.
        <span className="sup">32</span>Here, too, the people were amazed at the
        things he said. For he spoke as one who knew the truth, instead of
        merely quoting the opinions of others as his authority.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Once as he was teaching in the synagogue,
        a man possessed by a demon began shouting at Jesus,
        <span className="sup">34</span>"Go away! We want nothing to do with you,
        Jesus from Nazareth. You have come to destroy us. I know who you
        are--the Holy Son of God."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">35</span>Jesus cut them short.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Be silent!" <span>he told the demon. </span>"Come out!"
        </span>
        Then demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched, and then
        left him without hurting him further.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Amazed, the people asked, "What is in
        this man's words that even demons obey him?"{' '}
        <span className="sup">37</span>The story of what he had done spread like
        wildfire throughout the whole region.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>After leaving the synagogue that day, he
        went to Simon's home where he found Simon's mother-in-law very sick with
        a high fever. "Please heal her," everyone begged.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>Standing at her bedside he spoke to the
        fever, rebuking it, and immediately her temperature returned to normal
        and she got up and prepared a meal for them!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>As the sun went down that evening, all
        the villagers who had any sick people in their homes, no matter what
        their diseases were, brought them to Jesus; and the touch of his hands
        healed every one! <span className="sup">41</span>Some were possessed by
        demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, "You are the
        Son of God." But because they knew he was the Christ, he stopped them
        and told them to be silent.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>Early the next morning he went out into
        the desert. The crowds searched everywhere for him and when they finally
        found him they begged him not to leave them, but to stay at Capernaum.
        <span className="sup">43</span>But he replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other places,
          too, for that is why I was sent."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">44</span>So he continued to travel around
        preaching in synagogues throughout Judea.
