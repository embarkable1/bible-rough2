      <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day as he was preaching on the shore of Lake Gennesaret, great
        crowds pressed in on him to listen to the Word of God.
        <span className="sup">2</span>He noticed two empty boats standing at the
        water's edge while the fishermen washed their nets.
        <span className="sup">3</span>Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus
        asked Simon, its owner, to push out a little into the water, so that he
        could sit in the boat and speak to the crowds from there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>When he had finished speaking, he said to
        Simon,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Now go out where it is deeper and let down your nets and you will
          catch a lot of fish!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>"Sir," Simon replied, "we worked hard all
        last night and didn't catch a thing. But if you say so, we'll try
        again."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>And this time their nets were so full that
        they began to tear! <span className="sup">7</span>A shout for help
        brought their partners in the other boat and soon both boats were filled
        with fish and on the verge of sinking.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>When Simon Peter realized what had
        happened, he fell to his knees before Jesus and said, "Oh, sir, please
        leave us--I'm too much of a sinner for you to have around."
        <span className="sup">9</span>For he was awestruck by the size of their
        catch, as were the others with him, <span className="sup">10</span>and
        his partners too--James and John, the sons of Zebedee. Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't be afraid! From now on you'll be fishing for the souls of men!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And as soon as they landed, they left
        everything and went with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>One day in a certain village he was
        visiting, there was a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When he saw
        Jesus he fell to the ground before him, face downward in the dust,
        begging to be healed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Sir," he said, "if you only will, you can clear me of every trace of my
        disease."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Jesus reached out and touched the man and
        said, <span class="jesus">"Of course I will. Be healed."</span> And the
        leprosy left him instantly! <span className="sup">14</span>Then Jesus
        instructed him to go at once without telling anyone what had happened
        and be examined by the Jewish Priest.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Offer the sacrifice Moses' law requires for lepers who are healed,"
          <span>he said.</span> "This will prove to everyone that you are well."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">15</span>Now the report of his power spread even
        faster and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their
        diseases. <span className="sup">16</span>But he often withdrew to the
        wilderness for prayer.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>One day while he was teaching, some
        Jewish religious leaders and teachers of the Law were sitting nearby.
        (It seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee
        and Judea, as well as from Jerusalem.) And the Lord's healing power was
        upon him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18,19</span>Then--look! Some men came carrying a
        paralyzed man on a sleeping mat. They tried to push through the crowd to
        Jesus but couldn't reach him. So they went up on the roof above him,
        took off some tiles and lowered the sick man down into the crowd, still
        on his sleeping mat, right in front of Jesus.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the
        man,
        <span class="jesus">"My friend, your sins are forgiven!"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>"Who does this fellow think he is?" the
        Pharisees and teachers of the Law exclaimed among themselves. "This is
        blasphemy! Who but God can forgive sins?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Jesus knew what they were thinking, and
        he replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Why is it blasphemy? <span className="sup">23,24</span>I, the
          Messiah, have the authority on earth to forgive sins. But talk is
          cheap--anybody could say that. So I'll prove it to you by healing this
          man."
          <span>Then, turning to the paralyzed man, he commanded,</span> "Pick
          up your stretcher and go on home, for you are healed!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>And immediately, as everyone watched, the
        man jumped to his feet, picked up his mat and went home praising God!
        <span className="sup">26</span>Everyone present was gripped with awe and
        fear. And they praised God, remarking over and over again, "We have seen
        strange things today."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">27</span>Later on as Jesus left the town he saw a
        tax collector--with the usual reputation for cheating--sitting at a tax
        collection booth. The man's name was Levi. Jesus said to him,
        <span class="jesus">"Come and be one of my disciples!"</span>
        <span className="sup">28</span>So Levi left everything, sprang up and
        went with him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">29</span>Soon Levi held a reception in his home
        with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi's fellow tax collectors
        and other guests were there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">30</span>But the Pharisees and teachers of the Law
        complained bitterly to Jesus' disciples about his eating with such
        notorious sinners.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>Jesus answered them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "It is the sick who need a doctor, not those in good health.
          <span className="sup">32</span>My purpose is to invite sinners to turn
          from their sins, not to spend my time with those who think themselves
          already good enough."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">33</span>Their next complaint was that Jesus'
        disciples were feasting instead of fasting. "John the Baptist's
        disciples are constantly going without food, and praying," they
        declared, "and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are yours
        wining and dining?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>Jesus asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Do happy men fast? Do wedding guests go hungry while celebrating with
          the groom? <span className="sup">35</span>But the time will come when
          the bridegroom will be killed; then they won't want to eat."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then Jesus used this illustration:
        <span class="jesus">
          "No one tears off a piece of a new garment to make a patch for an old
          one. Not only will the new garment be ruined, but the old garment will
          look worse with a new patch on it! <span className="sup">37</span>And
          no one puts new wine into old wineskins, for the new wine bursts the
          old skins, ruining the skins and spilling the wine.
          <span className="sup">38</span>New wine must be put into new
          wineskins.
          <span className="sup">39</span>But no one after drinking the old wine
          seems to want the fresh and the new. 'The old ways are the best,' they
          say."
        </span>
      </p>
    </>
  );
