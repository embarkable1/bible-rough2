      <h3>Chapter 19</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        As Jesus was passing through Jericho, a man named Zacchaeus, one of the
        most influential Jews in the Roman tax-collecting business (and, of
        course, a very rich man), <span className="sup">3</span>tried to get a
        look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowds.
        <span className="sup">4</span>So he ran ahead and climbed into a
        sycamore tree beside the road, to watch from there.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>When Jesus came by he looked up at
        Zacchaeus and called him by name! "Zacchaeus!" he said.
        <span class="jesus">
          "Quick! Come down! For I am going to be a guest in your home today!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>Zacchaeus hurriedly climbed down and took
        Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>But the crowds were displeased. "He has
        gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner," they grumbled.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">8</span>Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord
        and said, "Sir, from now on I will give half my wealth to the poor, and
        if I find I have overcharged anyone on his taxes, I will penalize myself
        by giving him back four times as much!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9,10</span>Jesus told him,
        <span class="jesus">
          "This shows that salvation has come to this home today. This man was
          one of the lost sons of Abraham, and I, the Messiah, have come to
          search for and to save such souls as his."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>And because Jesus was nearing Jerusalem,
        he told a story to correct the impression that the Kingdom of God would
        begin right away.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>"A nobleman living in a certain province
        was called away to the distant capital of the empire to be crowned king
        of his province. <span className="sup">13</span>Before he left he called
        together ten assistants and gave them each $2,000 to invest while he was
        gone. <span className="sup">14</span>But some of his people hated him
        and sent him their declaration of independence, stating that they had
        rebelled and would not acknowledge him as their king.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>"Upon his return he called in the men to
        whom he had given the money, to find out what they had done with it, and
        what their profits were.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>"The first man reported a tremendous
        gain--ten times as much as the original amount!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>"'Fine!' the king exclaimed. 'You are a
        good man. You have been faithful with the little I entrusted to you, and
        as your reward, you shall be governor of ten cities.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>"The next man also reported a splendid
        gain--five times the original amount.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"'All right!' his master said, 'You can
        be governor over five cities.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>"But the third man brought back only the
        money he had started with. 'I've kept it safe,' he said,
        <span className="sup">21</span>'because I was afraid [you would demand
        my profits], for you are a hard man to deal with, taking what isn't
        yours and even confiscating the crops that others plant.'
        <span className="sup">22</span>'You vile and wicked slave,' the king
        roared. 'Hard, am I? That's exactly how I'll be toward you! If you knew
        so much about me and how tough I am, <span className="sup">23</span>then
        why didn't you deposit the money in the bank so that I could at least
        get some interest on it?'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>"Then turning to the others standing by
        he ordered, 'Take the money away from him and give it to the man who
        earned the most.'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">25</span>"'But, sir,' they said, 'he has enough
        already!'
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"'Yes,' the king replied, 'but it is
        always true that those who have, get more, and those who have little,
        soon lose even that. <span className="sup">27</span>And now about these
        enemies of mine who revolted--bring them in and execute them before
        me.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>After telling this story, Jesus went on
        towards Jerusalem, walking along ahead of his disciples.
        <span className="sup">29</span>As they came to the towns of Bethphage
        and Bethany, on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead,
        <span className="sup">30</span>with instructions to go to the next
        village, and as they entered they were to look for a donkey tied beside
        the road. It would be a colt, not yet broken for riding.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Untie him, <span>Jesus said, </span>"and bring him here.
        <span className="sup">31</span>And if anyone asks you what you are
        doing, just say, 'The Lord needs him.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>They found the colt as Jesus said,
        <span className="sup">33</span>and sure enough, as they were untying it,
        the owners demanded an explanation.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "What are you doing?" they asked. "Why are you untying our colt?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>And the disciples simply replied, "The
        Lord needs him!" <span className="sup">35</span>So they brought the colt
        to Jesus and threw some of their clothing across its back for Jesus to
        sit on.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36,37</span>Then the crowds spread out their robes
        along the road ahead of him, and as they reached the place where the
        road started down from the Mount of Olives, the whole procession began
        to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the
        wonderful miracles Jesus had done.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>"God has given us a King!" they exulted.
        "Long live the King! Let all heaven rejoice! Glory to God in the highest
        heavens!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>But some of the Pharisees among the crowd
        said, "Sir, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40</span>He replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "If they keep quiet, the stones along the road will burst into
          cheers!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>But as they came closer to Jerusalem and
        he saw the city ahead, he began to cry. <span className="sup">42</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Eternal peace was within your reach and you turned it down,"
          <span>he wept, </span>"and now it is too late.
          <span className="sup">43</span>Your enemies will pile up earth against
          your walls and encircle you and close in on you,
          <span className="sup">44</span>and crush you to the ground, and your
          children within you; your enemies will not leave one stone upon
          another--for you have rejected the opportunity God offered you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">45</span>Then he entered the Temple and began to
        drive out the merchants from their stalls,{' '}
        <span className="sup">46</span>saying to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Scriptures declare, 'My Temple is a place of prayer; but you have
          turned it into a den of thieves.'"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>After that he taught daily in the Temple,
        but the chief priests and other religious leaders and the business
        community were trying to find some way to get rid of him.
        <span className="sup">48</span>But they could think of nothing, for he
        was a hero to the people--they hung on every word he said.
