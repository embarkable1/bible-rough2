      <h3>Chapter 17</h3>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "There will always be temptations to sin,"
        <span>Jesus said one day to his disciples,</span> "but woe to the man
        who does the tempting. <span className="sup">2,3</span>If he were thrown
        into the sea with a huge rock tied to his neck, he would be far better
        off than facing the punishment in store for those who harm these little
        children's souls. I am warning you!
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Rebuke your brother if he sins, and forgive him if he is sorry.
        <span className="sup">4</span>Even if he wrongs you seven times a day
        and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, forgive him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>One day the apostles said to the Lord, "We
        need more faith; tell us how to get it."
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"If your faith were only the size of a
        mustard seed," <span>Jesus answered,</span> "it would be large enough to
        uproot that mulberry tree over there and send it hurtling into the sea!
        Your command would bring immediate results!
        <span className="sup">7,8,9</span>When a servant comes in from plowing
        or taking care of sheep, he doesn't just sit down and eat, but first
        prepares his master's meal and serves him his supper before he eats his
        own. And he is not even thanked, for he is merely doing what he is
        supposed to do. <span className="sup">10</span>Just so, if you merely
        obey me, you should not consider yourselves worthy of praise. For you
        have simply done your duty!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>As they continued onward toward
        Jerusalem, they reached the border between Galilee and Samaria,
        <span className="sup">12</span>and as they entered a village there, ten
        lepers stood at a distance, <span className="sup">13</span>crying out,
        "Jesus, sir, have mercy on us!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>He looked at them and said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Go to the Jewish priest and show him that you are healed!"
        </span>
        And as they were going, their leprosy disappeared.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>One of them came back to Jesus, shouting,
        "Glory to God, I'm healed!" <span className="sup">16</span>He fell flat
        on the ground in front of Jesus, face downward in the dust, thanking him
        for what he had done. This man was a despised Samaritan.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17</span>Jesus asked,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Didn't I heal ten men? Where are the nine?
          <span className="sup">18</span>Does only this foreigner return to give
          glory to God?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>And Jesus said to the man,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Stand up and go; your faith has made you well."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, "When
        will the Kingdom of God begin?" Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "The Kingdom of God isn't ushered in with visible signs.
          <span className="sup">21</span>You won't be able to say, 'It has begun
          here in this place or there in that part of the country.' For the
          Kingdom of God is within you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Later he talked again about this with his
        disciples.
        <span class="jesus">
          "The time is coming when you will long for me to be with you even for
          a single day, but I won't be here,"
          <span>
            he said, <span className="sup">23</span>{' '}
          </span>
          "Reports will reach you that I have returned and that I am in this
          place or that; don't believe it or go out to look for me.{' '}
          <span className="sup">24</span>For when I return, you will know it
          beyond all doubt. It will be as evident as the lightning that flashes
          across the skies.
          <span className="sup">25</span>But first I must suffer terribly and be
          rejected by this whole nation.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>"[When I return] the world will be [as
        indifferent to the things of God] as the people were in Noah's day.
        <span className="sup">27</span>They ate and drank and
        married--everything just as usual right up to the day when Noah went
        into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>"And the world will be as it was in the
        days of Lot: people went about their daily business--eating and
        drinking, buying and selling, farming and building--
        <span className="sup">29</span>until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then
        fire and brimstone rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
        <span className="sup">30</span>Yes, it will be 'business as usual' right
        up to the hour of my return.
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        <span className="sup">31</span>"Those away from home that day must not
        return to pack; those in the fields must not return to town--
        <span className="sup">32</span>remember what happened to Lot's wife!
        <span className="sup">33</span>Whoever clings to his life shall lose it,
        and whoever loses his life shall save it.{' '}
        <span className="sup">34</span>That night two men will be asleep in the
        same room, and one will be taken away, the other left.{' '}
        <span className="sup">35,36</span>Two women will be working together at
        household tasks; one will be taken, the other left; and so it will be
        with men working side by side in the fields."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>"Lord, where will they be taken?" the
        disciples asked.

      <p className="quote">
        Jesus replied,
