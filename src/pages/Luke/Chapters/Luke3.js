      <h3>Chapter 3</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius Caesar, a message
        came from God to John (the son of Zacharias), as he was living out in
        the deserts. (Pilate was governor over Judea at that time; Herod, over
        Galilee; his brother Philip, over Iturea and Trachonitis; Lysanias, over
        Abilene; and Annas and Caiaphas were High Priests.)
        <span className="sup">3</span>Then John went from place to place on both
        sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to
        show that they had turned to God and away from their sins, in order to
        be forgiven.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>In the words of Isaiah the prophet, John
        was "a voice shouting from the barren wilderness, 'Prepare a road for
        the Lord to travel on! Widen the pathway before him!
        <span className="sup">5</span>Level the mountains! Fill up the valleys!
        Straighten the curves! Smooth out the ruts!
        <span className="sup">6</span>And then all mankind shall see the Savior
        sent from God.'"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>Here is a sample of John's preaching to
        the crowds that came for baptism: "You brood of snakes! You are trying
        to escape hell without truly turning to God! That is why you want to be
        baptized! <span className="sup">8</span>First go and prove by the way
        you live that you really have repented. And don't think you are safe
        because you are descendants of Abraham. That isn't enough. God can
        produce children of Abraham from these desert stones!
        <span className="sup">9</span>The axe of his judgment is poised over
        you, ready to sever your roots and cut you down. Yes, every tree that
        does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the
        fire."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>The crowd replied, "What do you want us
        to do?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>"If you have two coats," he replied,
        "give one to the poor. If you have extra food, give it away to those who
        are hungry."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Even tax collectors--notorious for their
        corruption--came to be baptized and asked, "How shall we prove to you
        that we have abandoned our sins?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>"By your honesty," he replied. "Make sure
        you collect no more taxes than the Roman government requires you to."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">14</span>"And us," asked some soldiers, "what
        about us?"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        John replied, "Don't extort money by threats and violence; don't accuse
        anyone of what you know he didn't do; and be content with your pay!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">15</span>Everyone was expecting the Messiah to
        come soon, and eager to know whether or not John was he. This was the
        question of the hour, and was being discussed everywhere.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>John answered the question by saying, "I
        baptize only with water; but someone is coming soon who has far higher
        authority than mine; in fact, I am not even worthy of being his slave.
        He will baptize you with fire--with the Holy Spirit.
        <span className="sup">17</span>He will separate chaff from grain, and
        burn up the chaff with eternal fire and store away the grain."
        <span className="sup">18</span>He used many such warnings as he
        announced the Good News to the people.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19,20</span>(But after John had publicly
        criticized Herod, governor of Galilee, for marrying Herodias, his
        brother's wife, and for many other wrongs he had done, Herod put John in
        prison, thus adding this sin to all his many others.){' '}
        <span className="sup">21</span>Then one day, after the crowds had been
        baptized, Jesus himself was baptized; and as he was praying, the heavens
        opened,
        <span className="sup">22</span>and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove
        settled upon him, and a voice from heaven said, "You are my much loved
        Son, yes, my delight."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23-38</span>Jesus was about thirty years old when
        he began his public ministry.
