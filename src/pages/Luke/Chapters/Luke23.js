      <h3>Chapter 23</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        Then the entire Council took Jesus over to Pilate the governor.
        <span className="sup">2</span>The began at once accusing him: "This
        fellow has been leading our people to ruin by telling them not to pay
        their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is our Messiah--a
        King."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>So Pilate asked him, "Are you their
        Messiah--their King?"
      </p>
      <p class="jesus quote">
        "Yes," <span>Jesus replied, </span>"it is as you say."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">4</span>Then Pilate turned to the chief priests
        and to the mob and said, "So? That isn't a crime!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>Then they became desperate. "But he is
        causing riots against the government everywhere he goes, all over Judea,
        from Galilee to Jerusalem!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>"Is he then a Galilean?" Pilate asked.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>When they told him yes, Pilate said to
        take him to King Herod, for Galilee was under Herod's jurisdiction; and
        Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time.{' '}
        <span className="sup">8</span>Herod was delighted at the opportunity to
        see Jesus, for he had heard a lot about him and had been hoping to see
        him perform a miracle.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>He asked Jesus question after question,
        but there was no reply. <span className="sup">10</span>Meanwhile, the
        chief priests and the other religious leaders stood there shouting their
        accusations.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">11</span>Now Herod and his soldiers began mocking
        and ridiculing Jesus; and putting a kingly robe on him, they sent him
        back to Pilate. <span className="sup">12</span>That day Herod and
        Pilate--enemies before--became fast friends.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>Then Pilate called together the chief
        priests and other Jewish leaders, along with the people,
        <span className="sup">14</span>and announced his verdict:
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "You brought this man to me, accusing him of leading a revolt against
        the Roman government. I have examined him thoroughly on this point and
        find him innocent. <span className="sup">15</span>Herod came to the same
        conclusion and sent him back to us--nothing this man has done calls for
        the death penalty. <span className="sup">16</span>I will therefore have
        him scourged with leaded thongs, and release him."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">17,18</span>But now a mighty roar rose from the
        crowd as with one voice they shouted, "Kill him, and release Barabbas to
        us!"
        <span className="sup">19</span>(Barabbas was in prison for starting an
        insurrection in Jerusalem against the government, and for murder.)
        <span className="sup">20</span>Pilate argued with them, for he wanted to
        release Jesus. <span className="sup">21</span>But they shouted, "Crucify
        him! Crucify him!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">22</span>Once more, for the third time, he
        demanded, "Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to
        sentence him to death. I will therefore scourge him and let him go."
        <span className="sup">23</span>But they shouted louder and louder for
        Jesus' death, and their voices prevailed.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">24</span>So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they
        demanded. <span className="sup">25</span>And he released Barabbas, the
        man in prison for insurrection and murder, at their request. But he
        delivered Jesus over to them to do with as they would.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>As the crowd led Jesus away to his death,
        Simon of Cyrene, who was just coming into Jerusalem from the country,
        was forced to follow, carrying Jesus' cross.
        <span className="sup">27</span>Great crowds trailed along behind, and
        many grief-stricken women.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>But Jesus turned and said to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but for yourselves and for
          your children. <span className="sup">29</span>For the days are coming
          when the women who have no children will be counted fortunate indeed.
          <span className="sup">30</span>Mankind will beg the mountains to fall
          on them and crush them, and the hills to bury them.
          <span className="sup">31</span>For if such things as this are done to
          me, the Living Tree, what will they do to you?"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32,33</span>Two others, criminals, were led out to
        be executed with him at a place called "The Skull." There all three were
        crucified--Jesus on the center cross, and the two criminals on either
        side.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Father, forgive these people," <span>Jesus said,</span> "for they
          don't know what they are doing."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        And the soldiers gambled for his clothing, throwing dice for each piece.
        <span className="sup">35</span>The crowd watched. And the Jewish leaders
        laughed and scoffed. "He was so good at helping others," they said,
        "let's see him save himself if he is really God's Chosen One, the
        Messiah."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>The soldiers mocked him, too, by offering
        him a drink--of sour wine. <span className="sup">37</span>And they
        called to him, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">38</span>A signboard was nailed to the cross above
        him with these words: "This is the King of the Jews."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">39</span>One of the criminals hanging beside him
        scoffed, "So you're the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving
        yourself--and us, too, while you're at it!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">40,41</span>But the other criminal protested.
        "Don't you even fear God when you are dying? We deserve to die for our
        evil deeds, but this man hasn't done one thing wrong."
        <span className="sup">42</span>Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when
        you come into your Kingdom."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>And Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Today you will be with me in Paradise. This is a solemn promise."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">44</span>By now it was noon, and darkness fell
        across the whole land for three hours, until three o'clock.
        <span className="sup">45</span>The light from the sun was gone--and
        suddenly the thick veil hanging in the Temple split apart.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Then Jesus shouted,
        <span class="jesus">"Father, I commit my spirit to you,"</span> and with
        those words he died.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">47</span>When the captain of the Roman military
        unit handling the executions saw what had happened, he was stricken with
        awe before God and said, "Surely this man was innocent."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">48</span>And when the crowd that came to see the
        crucifixion saw that Jesus was dead, they went home in deep sorrow.
        <span className="sup">49</span>Meanwhile, Jesus' friends, including the
        women who had followed him down from Galilee, stood in the distance
        watching.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50,51,52</span>Then a man named Joseph, a member
        of the Jewish Supreme Court, from the city of Arimathea in Judea, went
        to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. He was a godly man who had
        been expecting the Messiah's coming and had not agreed with the decision
        and actions of the other Jewish leaders. <span className="sup">53</span>
        So he took down Jesus' body and wrapped it in long linen cloth and laid
        it in a new, unused tomb hewn into the rock [at the side of a hill].
        <span className="sup">54</span>This was done late on Friday afternoon,
        the day of the preparation for the Sabbath.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">55</span>As the body was taken away, the women
        from Galilee followed and saw it carried into the tomb.
        <span className="sup">56</span>Then they went home and prepared spices
        and ointments to embalm him; but by the time they were finished it was
        the Sabbath, so they rested all that day as required by the Jewish law.
