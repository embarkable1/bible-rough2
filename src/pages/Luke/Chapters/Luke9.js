      <h3>Chapter 9</h3>
      <p className="quote">
        One day Jesus called together his twelve apostles and gave them
        authority over all demons--power to cast them out--and to heal all
        diseases. <span className="sup">2</span>Then he sent them away to tell
        everyone about the coming of the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">3</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Don't even take along a walking stick,"
          <span>he instructed them, </span>"nor a beggar's bag, nor food, nor
          money. Not even an extra coat. <span className="sup">4</span>Be a
          guest in only one home at each village.
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">5</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "If the people of a town won't listen to you when you enter it, turn
          around and leave, demonstrating God's anger against it by shaking its
          dust from your feet as you go."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">6</span>So they began their circuit of the
        villages, preaching the Good News and healing the sick.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">7</span>When reports of Jesus' miracles reached
        Herod, the governor, he was worried and puzzled, for some were saying,
        "This is John the Baptist come back to life again";{' '}
        <span className="sup">8</span>and others, "It is Elijah or some other
        ancient prophet risen from the dead." These rumors were circulating all
        over the land.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">9</span>"I beheaded John," Herod said, "so who is
        this man about whom I hear such strange stories?" And he tried to see
        him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">10</span>After the apostles returned to Jesus and
        reported what they had done, he slipped quietly away with them toward
        the city of Bethsaida. <span className="sup">11</span>But the crowds
        found out where he was going, and followed. And he welcomed them,
        teaching them again about the Kingdom of God and curing those who were
        ill.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">12</span>Late in the afternoon all twelve of the
        disciples came and urged him to send the people away to the nearby
        villages and farms, to find food and lodging for the night. "For there
        is nothing to eat here in this deserted spot," they said.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">13</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          " <em>You</em> feed them!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        "Why, we have only five loaves of bread and two fish among the lot of
        us," they protested; "or are you expecting us to go and buy enough for
        this whole mob?" <span className="sup">14</span>For there were about
        5,000 men there!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span class="jesus">
          "Just tell them to sit down on the ground in groups of about fifty
          each,"
        </span>
        Jesus replied. <span className="sup">15</span>So they did.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">16</span>Jesus took the five loaves and two fish
        and looked up into the sky and gave thanks; then he broke off pieces for
        his disciples to set before the crowd. <span className="sup">17</span>
        And everyone ate and ate; still, twelve basketfuls of scraps were picked
        up afterwards!
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">18</span>One day as he was alone, praying, with
        his disciples nearby, he came over and asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Who are the people saying I am?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">19</span>"John the Baptist," they told him, "or
        perhaps Elijah or one of the other ancient prophets risen from the
        dead."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">20</span>Then he asked them,
        <span class="jesus">"Who do you think I am?"</span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">Peter replied, "The Messiah--the Christ of God!"</p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">21</span>He gave them strict orders not to speak
        of this to anyone. <span className="sup">22</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "For I, the Messiah, must suffer much," <span>he said,</span> "and be
          rejected by the Jewish leaders--the elders, chief priests, and
          teachers of the Law--and be killed; and three days later I will come
          back to life again!"
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">23</span>Then he said to all,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Anyone who wants to follow me must put aside his own desires and
          conveniences and carry his cross with him every day and
          <em>keep close to me!</em> <span className="sup">24</span>Whoever
          loses his life for my sake will save it, hut whoever insists on
          keeping his life will lose it; <span className="sup">25</span>and what
          profit is there in gaining the whole world when it means forfeiting
          one's self?
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">26</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "When I, the Messiah, come in my glory and in the glory of the Father
          and the holy angels, I will be ashamed then of all who are ashamed of
          me and of my words now. <span className="sup">27</span>But this is the
          simple truth--some of you who are standing here right now will not die
          until you have seen the Kingdom of God."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">28</span>Eight days later he took Peter, James,
        and John with him into the hills to pray.{' '}
        <span className="sup">29</span>And as he was praying, his face began to
        shine, and his clothes became dazzling white and blazed with light.{' '}
        <span className="sup">30</span>Then two men appeared and began talking
        with him--Moses and Elijah!
        <span className="sup">31</span>They were splendid in appearance,
        glorious to see; and they were speaking of his death at Jerusalem, to be
        carried out in accordance with God's plan.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">32</span>Peter and the others had been very drowsy
        and had fallen asleep. Now they woke up and saw Jesus covered with
        brightness and glory, and the two men standing with him.
        <span className="sup">33</span>As Moses and Elijah were starting to
        leave, Peter, all confused and not even knowing what he was saying,
        blurted out, "Master, this is wonderful! We'll put up three
        shelters--one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah!"
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">34</span>But even as he was saying this, a bright
        cloud formed above them; and terror gripped them as it covered them.
        <span className="sup">35</span>And a voice from the cloud said, "
        <em>This</em> is my Son, my Chosen One; listen to <em>him</em>."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">36</span>Then, as the voice died away, Jesus was
        there alone with his disciples. They didn't tell anyone what they had
        seen until long afterwards.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">37</span>The next day as they descended from the
        hill, a huge crowd met him, <span className="sup">38</span>and a man in
        the crowd called out to him, "Teacher, this boy here is my only son,
        <span className="sup">39</span>and a demon keeps seizing him, making him
        scream; and it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the
        mouth; it is always hitting him and hardly ever leaves him alone.
        <span className="sup">40</span>I begged your disciples to cast the demon
        out, but they couldn't."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">41</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "O you stubborn faithless people,"
          <span>Jesus said [to his disciples],</span> "how long should I put up
          with you? Bring him here."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">42</span>As the boy was coming the demon knocked
        him to the ground and threw him into a violent convulsion. But Jesus
        ordered the demon to come out, and healed the boy and handed him over to
        his father.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">43</span>Awe gripped the people as they saw this
        display of the power of God.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        Meanwhile, as they were exclaiming over all the wonderful things he was
        doing, Jesus said to his disciples, <span className="sup">44</span>
        <span class="jesus">
          "Listen to me and remember what I say. I, the Messiah, am going to be
          betrayed."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">45</span>But the disciples didn't know what he
        meant, for their minds had been sealed and they were afraid to ask him.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">46</span>Now came an argument among them as to
        which of them would be greatest [in the coming Kingdom]!
        <span className="sup">47</span>But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he
        stood a little child beside him <span className="sup">48</span>and said
        to them,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Anyone who takes care of a little child like this is caring for me!
          And whoever cares for me is caring for God who sent me. Your care for
          others is the measure of your greatness."
        </span>
        <span className="sup">49</span>His disciple John came to him and said,
        "Master, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons. And we told
        him not to. After all, he isn't in our group."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">50</span>But Jesus said,
        <span class="jesus">
          "You shouldn't have done that! For anyone who is not against you is
          for you."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">51</span>As the time drew near for his return to
        heaven, he moved steadily onward towards Jerusalem with an iron will.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">52</span>One day he sent messengers ahead to
        reserve rooms for them in a Samaritan village.{' '}
        <span className="sup">53</span>But they were turned away! The people of
        the village refused to have anything to do with them because they were
        headed for Jerusalem.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">54</span>When word came back of what had happened,
        James and John said to Jesus, "Master, shall we order fire down from
        heaven to burn them up?" <span className="sup">55</span>But Jesus turned
        and rebuked them, <span className="sup">56</span>and they went on to
        another village.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">57</span>As they were walking along someone said
        to Jesus, "I will always follow you no matter where you go."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">58</span>But Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Remember, I don't even own a place to lay my head. Foxes have dens to
          live in, and birds have nests, but I, the Messiah, have no earthly
          home at all."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">59</span>Another time, when he invited a man to
        come with him and to be his disciple, the man agreed--but wanted to wait
        until his father's death.
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">60</span>Jesus replied,
        <span class="jesus">
          "Let those without eternal life concern themselves with things like
          that. Your duty is to come and preach the coming of the Kingdom of God
          to all the world."
        </span>
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">61</span>Another said, "Yes, Lord, I will come,
        but first let me ask permission of those at home."
      </p>
      <p className="quote">
        <span className="sup">62</span>But Jesus told him,

          "Anyone who lets himself be distracted from the work I plan for him is
          not fit for the Kingdom of God."
